### The header

The portal header provides the context of your location inside the platform. It is a persistent element that remains at the top of every page. Depending on the service context you are in, the header bar provides additional navigation capabilities that are specific to that service.



The portal header offers quick access to essential features and tools, as follows:

1. The app launcher - allows you to switch between different products or modules within the platform.
2. Your current location - shows your location within the platform.
3. The help menu - provides access to the UiPath documentation, support resources, enables you to submit feedback, and provides assistance channels for any questions or issues you may encounter. The documentation experience offers a search feature powered by generative AI. The search generates answers using UiPath's official documentation as a reference. While the search aims for accuracy, we suggest you cross-check the responses with the referenced documentation sources for complete precision.
4. The notification menu - keeps you informed about updates, alerts, and notifications relevant to your user persona and activities within the platform also allows you to configure notification settings. Refer to details about reading notifications and managing them.
5. The tenant picker - displays the active tenant and enables swift tenant switching.
