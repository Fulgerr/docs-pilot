### Restrict or allow concurrent sessions

This feature governs user sessions within web browsers. It determines whether a user can have more than one active session at the same time.If the Limit Concurrent Sessions option is enabled, it restricts users to a single active session at any given time. If a user is already logged in and attempts to log in from another browser or device, the previous session is terminated.If the Limit Concurrent Sessions option is disabled, users can log in from different browsers or devices simultaneously. Each login is treated as a separate session, and users can switch between them without being automatically disconnected from the previous sessions.To change concurrent sessions settings:

Go to Admin, select your organization, and then select Security.The Security Settings page for the organization opens.Along the top, select the Session Policy tab.Select the toggle next to Limit Concurrent Sessions to enable or disable this setting.Select Save in the bottom right corner of the page.

A confirmation message appears in the top right after the change is applied.
