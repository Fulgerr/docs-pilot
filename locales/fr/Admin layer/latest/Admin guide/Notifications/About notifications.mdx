# About notifications

Notifications offer ordered and prioritized information about your actions, as a user, or about the actions that you manage, as an admin.

In-app notifications are sent across tenants, via the Notifications panel.

Email notifications are sent across tenants, to the email address that was used when creating the organization account.
