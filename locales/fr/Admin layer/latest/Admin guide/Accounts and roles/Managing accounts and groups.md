# Managing accounts and groups

Organization administrators can view, add, edit, or remove accounts and groups at the organization level.

## Adding groups

You can add new groups if you want to define a custom mix of roles and license allocation rules to use for a particular group of accounts. For example, the ones needed by your colleagues in the Accounting department to use Automation Suite.

In the Accounts & Groups page, navigate to the Groups tab.Select Add Group. The Add Group window is displayed.Fill in the Name field.In the Names field, add users to the group. Only users that have been invited to your organization beforehand are listed.

Unlike default user groups, custom groups need to be added manually to your services to allocate roles.


## Adding accounts




### Adding user accounts

Go to Admin >organization >Accounts & Groups and select the Users tab.Select Add User. The Add User panel opens from the right of the window.Fill in the fields with the user's details.If you are integrated with an external directory, the password is not required and, if system email notifications are set up, the user receives an email with their account details and can set their own password at first login. If not, you must set a password for the account. The user will need the email address (or username) and password to log in.Under Group Membership, select the checkboxes for the groups to which you want to add the user.If your groups are properly set up, the user should already have the access they need to start working in Automation Suite{Delivery option no TM}.Select Save to add the account.

The panel closes and the new account is available in the list of user accounts.


### Adding robot accounts

Go to Admin >organization >Accounts & Groups and select the Robot accounts tab.In the top right, select Add Robot Account.The Add Robot Account panel opens at the right of the page.In the Name field, type a descriptive name for the account.Choose wisely. You cannot change the name of the robot account later. If you need to rename it, you must delete the account and create a new one with a new name.Optionally, under Group Membership, select the checkbox for groups to which you want to add the account.Adding the account to one or more groups means it inherits any roles, user licenses, or robot settings defined for the group.Select Add.A success message appears at the top of the panel and further guidance is displayed.

The robot account is added and is now visible on the Robot accounts page. It is also added to the groups you selected.Continue the setup of the robot account in UiPath Orchestrator as you would set up a user account for unattended use: Unattended Setup.Continue the setup of the robot account in UiPath Orchestrator as you would set up a user account for unattended use: Configuring robot accounts to run unattended automations.


## Adding accounts to groups

Adding an account - either user or robot - to a group means the account inherits the roles and licenses assigned to the group.You can check roles for a group from Orchestrator and you can check license allocation rules for the group from the Licenses page.

Go to Admin> organization >Accounts & Groups and select the Groups tab.Select Edit.In the Names field, type to search for a user or robot account.Select the account from the list of results to add it to the group. Select Save.


## Editing an account or group

You edit accounts and groups in the same way:

Go to Admin >organization >Accounts & Groups and select the appropriate tab.Select Edit.Make changes as needed. Select Save.


## Checking the roles for an account or group

You can check the roles assigned to an account or group from UiPath Orchestrator.

Go to Tenant > Manage Access > Assign roles and select Check roles & permissions. You can search for any account or group to view the assigned roles.

In the Check roles window, each permission is listed on a per-folder basis. Adjacent to each permission, you can view whether it has been explicitly assigned or inherited from the tenant.

To check the assigned roles, take the following steps:

1. From UiPath Orchestrator, go to Tenant > Manage Access > Access rules.
2. Search for a specific account or group.
3. Click More Actions > View Access to view the assigned roles and permissions.

To assign roles to multiple accounts, refer to Assigning multiple accounts.


## Removing an account or group

Go to Admin >organization >Accounts & Groups, and select the appropriate tab.Select Remove.In the dialog, confirm the action to proceed with the removal.


### Effects of removal

For accounts: After the account is removed, the user or service can no longer log
			in to {Delivery option}.

For groups, after the group is removed:

* Any roles, licenses, or robot setup for the removed group are revoked from all user accounts that belonged to the group.
* If a user account that was a part of the
				removed group does not have any other roles (either directly assigned or inherited
				from other groups), they can still log in, but they have read-only rights.
