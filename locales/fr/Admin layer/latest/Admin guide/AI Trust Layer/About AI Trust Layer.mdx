# About AI Trust Layer

The AI Trust Layer card allows you to directly oversee and govern UiPath GenAI features across all UiPath products. Its
            purpose is to act as an administrative panel for GenAI as well as any third-party AI
            models, providing comprehensive management and strict control capabilities, including an
            auditing and usage panel.

A key tenet of the AI Trust Layer is ensuring that your data remains confidential and
            secure, never to be shared or reused outside of the UiPath
            environment.
