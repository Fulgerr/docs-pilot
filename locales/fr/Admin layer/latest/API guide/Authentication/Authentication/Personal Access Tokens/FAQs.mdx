# I don't see the Personal Access Token tab in my preferences

If you're unable to locate the option to generate Personal Access Tokens, it might be because you are a directory user. Personal Access Tokens are not available for directory users.

In this case, you can do one of the following:

* log in with a UiPath account instead of a directory account, or
* (recommended) use the OAuth flow instead.
