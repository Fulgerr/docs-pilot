# Allowing or restricting basic authentication

Basic authentication refers to signing in with the username and password of a local account.

If basic authentication is restricted, your users can only log in with their directory account, as defined in the external identity provider. Otherwise, users can log in with both their local accounts, if any, and their directory accounts.

# Configuration levels and inheritance

This option can be configured:

* At the host level: When set at the host level, the setting applies to all organizations and all their accounts, except if the basic authentication setting at the organization or account level was not explicitly set differently.
* For system administrator accounts: Even when all organizations are restricted from using basic authentication, you can allow system administrators only to bypass this restriction.
* At the organization level: If set at the organization level, the organization-level setting overrides the host-level setting for only that organization. The setting for an organization applies to all accounts that belong to that organization, except accounts for which basic authentication is set differently at the account level.
* At the account level: If set at the account level, the account-level setting overrides the host-level and organization-level basic authentication setting for only that account.

# Setting basic authentication at the host level

When set at the host level, the setting applies to all organizations and all their accounts. Set it according to the preference or recommendation across your company.

For exceptions, basic authentication can also be set at the organization or account level where you want this setting to apply differently.

To allow or restrict basic authentication for all organizations and all accounts, follow the instructions that apply to your user interface settings.

### Configuring basic authentication for host administrators

Log in to the host portal as a system administrator. Select Security. The Security Settings window opens.Select the Basic sign-in toggle to change if basic authentication is allowed or not.Turn on (right toggle position, blue toggle) to allow basic authentication for all users, host administrators included. The Allow basic authentication for the host administrators checkbox is not editable.Turn off (left toggle position, gray toggle) to restrict basic authentication for all users. While basic authentication is restricted, the Allow basic authentication for the host administrators checkbox is editable, allowing you to configure basic authentication settings only for host administrators.When basic authentication is disabled, select the Allow basic authentication for the host administrators checkbox to allow basic authentication only for system administrators. Even when basic authentication is not allowed through the configuration of an external provider, as an exception, it is allowed for system administrator accounts only.When basic authentication is disabled, clear the Allow basic authentication for the host administrators checkbox to also restrict basic authentication for system administrators.Select Save to apply your changes or Cancel to revert to the original settings.


### Recovering from lock out

When basic sign-in (basic authentication) is disabled, it is possible to get locked out if you lose access to your directory account.To recover from this situation, go to https://<FQDN>/host/orchestrator_/account/hostlogin and log in using your basic authentication credentials.
