# Managing organization administrators

Organization administrators in instanceName have permission to manage important settings in the platform such as users, roles, groups, licenses, organization settings, security, authentication, etc. Additionally, they can view all the service details of all tenants.

When a new organization is created in instanceName, the first user who created the organization is, by default, assigned as the organization administrator. It means, initially, the organization creator solely possesses the authority to modify or manage the integral functions within the organization.

If your only admin leaves, you could lose the ability to operate in instanceName. Always ensure you have a backup admin.
