# API endpoint URL structure

In this section, you can learn to construct API requests by understanding the URL structure of UiPath® endpoints.

# Base URL

The base URL is the starting point for all API requests. It serves as the foundation for constructing the endpoint URL. The base URL is {baseURL_vanilla}.

# Service path

The service path identifies the specific service you want to interact with.

For APIs that operate at the organization level, the service path typically comes right after the base URL. These APIs provide functionalities that are applicable across the entire organization, regardless of the specific tenants within that organization.

/identity_ - for interacting with functionalities related to creating, updating, or deleting accounts, and managing organization settings.

/audit_ - for interacting with functionalities related to audit logs in the organization.

/lrm - for interacting with functionalities related to licensing allocation to tenants and services in the organization.

/la - for tracking license usage (robot units, provisioned tenants and services, etc.)

When dealing with APIs that are specific to a particular tenant within an organization, the URL should include additional parameters to specify both the organization and the tenant before the service path. For example:

/{orgName}/{tenantName}/orchestrator_ - for interacting with Orchestrator resources in a specific tenant and organization.

/{orgName}/{tenantName}/dataservice_ - for interacting with Data Service resources in a specific tenant and organization.

For details on tenant API resources, refer to the specific product documentation.

# Entry point

api - signifies the entry point to the API platform management resources, for example ​/api​/Group​/

# Resource path

The resource path specifies the exact resource or operation you wish to perform. It might include keywords like Group, RobotAccount, Setting, depending on the purpose of the request.

# Path parameters

Path parameters are used to pass dynamic values to an API endpoint. These values help for identifying specific resources that are relevant to the API request. For example, ​/Group​/{partitionGlobalId}​/{groupId}

partitionGlobalId - the ID of the organization.

groupId - the ID of the group.

# Query parameters

Query parameters are additional parameters attached to the URL to provide more context or filters for the requested data. These are often preceded by a ? symbol and separated by & symbols. For instance, you might use query parameters to specify filtering criteria or pagination instructions.

ExamplePutting all components together, a URL for a organization-specific resource might look like this, {baseURL_identity}/api/group/{partitionGlobalId}​/{groupId}.A URL for tenant-specific resource can look like this: {baseURL_orchestrator}/odata/Assets.
