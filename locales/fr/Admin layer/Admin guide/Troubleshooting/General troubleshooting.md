## Browser group policies

Signing in to your Orchestrator service from the Assistant redirects you to the SSO page. In some browsers, you may be prompted to open UiPath Assistant. This happens due to the Assistant's protocol handler not being added to the browser's group policies.To prevent this behavior, make sure to follow the next steps, depending on the browser (Chrome/Microsoft Edge):

Open Registry Editor.Navigate to Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Google\Chrome/ or Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Edge, depending on the browser you use.Add a new key and name it AutoLaunchProtocolsFromOrigins.Select (Default) to edit the key.In the Edit String dialog, in the Value data field, add [{"allowed_origins": ["<https://myOrchestrator.uipath.com/"],"protocol":> "com.uipath.robot.oidc"}] and select OK.The AutoLaunchProtocolsFromOrigins policy requires Chrome 85 or later.Close all browser tabs and relaunch the browser. Verify that your browser applied the new policy by navigating to chrome://policy or edge://policy. The recently added policy should be listed under the Chrome Policies or Microsoft Edge section with the OK status.
