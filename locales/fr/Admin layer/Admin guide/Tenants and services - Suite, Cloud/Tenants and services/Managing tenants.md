This feature is not available on the Enterprise Trial licensing plan. These organizations are limited to one tenant, which is created automatically.

To create a new tenant, take the following steps:

Navigate to Admin in the {Delivery option} portal.In the Tenants view, select the Plus icon. The Create new tenant process starts with three steps to follow.On the General step, provide the following information:Enter a name for your tenant in the Name field.You can enter up to 32 alphabetical or numeric characters, starting with a letter. No spaces or special characters are allowed.You can change the tenant name later, but there are consequences. Refer to Changing the tenant name.(Optional) Select a color from the Color picker to identify your tenant in the header when operating within that tenant.Select a tenant type from the Environment type section.By selecting the environment type, you provide the specific configuration and infrastructure setup required for running and testing your automations.You can choose from three types of environments:Production tenants allow the latest versions of software, products, or updates to be pushed to users live.Development tenants are used for development purposes without impacting live or operational tenants.Staging tenants are used for testing purposes without impacting live or operational tenants, including canary environments.If you want to independently run and test automations with the latest features, select Use as a canary environment.For more information, refer to Using a canary environment.If you already have a canary environment, even if it is currently disabled, you cannot select the checkbox to create another canary environment.From the Region dropdown, choose the region for hosting your service data for your tenant.You cannot change the tenant region yourself after you create the tenant. If you need to change it later, you have to open a support ticket. When a tenant and associated data are moved to a new region, the tenant ID and folder ID are changed. You have to update your projects with the new tenant and folder IDs.Select Next to proceed to the Add services step.On the Add services step, select the checkboxes for the services that you want to make available within your new tenant.The Orchestrator service is mandatory. Other services are only available if you have free licenses for them.Services available in regions different from the chosen tenant region are labeled accordingly with the region in which they are hosted. For more information, refer to Tenant and service regions.Select Next to proceed to the License allocation step.On the License allocation step, you can observe the available number of licenses for each type that you can allocate to your new tenant. If you want to keep some of the available licenses for other tenants, you can allocate a lower number of licenses to your new tenant from each of the available license types.Select Create to close the wizard and create the tenant.

The new tenant is added to the Tenants panel and the tenant picker.Production type tenants can be identified through the  icon. Non-production type tenants can be identified through the  icon.To be able to work in the tenant, you or a service administrator must assign roles and licenses for the services in the new tenant to users. For more information, refer to:


### Changing the tenant region

Enterprise customers can choose the region of tenants when creating them. However, after creating the tenant you cannot change the region yourself.

If you need to move a tenant to a different region, open an SLA ticket and request the move to one of the available regions.


### Using a canary tenant

You can add a canary tenant to your organization to view and test upcoming changes before they reach your other tenants. The canary tenant serves as an isolated medium that uses your current setup where you can check on the impact that upcoming changes have within the context of your current organization.

With a canary tenant, you can:

* view and test enterprise-only features before they reach enterprise environments
* test and run the same automations that you use in production.

Do not use the canary tenant for production.This feature is a medium made available to you for testing purposes only and does not benefit from the same enterprise commitments as your other tenants.The uptime guarantee offered by your enterprise plan does not apply to the canary tenant.While we encourage reporting any potential issues you encounter within the canary tenant, please note that we will address them on a best-effort basis only.

# Early access window

The canary tenant receives updates to enterprise functionality for all of the supported services as soon as they are announced in the release notes, while your other tenants receive them at least 3 days later.

# Included services

Only the certain UiPath cloud services are available to be provisioned in a canary tenant, as described in the following table:

Service nameNotesRelease notesOrchestratorData retention for Orchestrator within the canary tenant is reduced to the thresholds for community plans.Orchestrator release notes

If a service is not listed in the table, then it does not receive early updates in the canary tenant.

To provision a service in your canary tenant, you need to have licenses for that service.

# Data residency

The canary tenant and its service data is always hosted in the European Union (Europe) region and you cannot choose a different region.

# Tips

To make the most of your canary tenant, we recommend setting it up in the same way as your production tenants. This includes replicating the same:

* tenant settings in UiPath Orchestrator
* service-level settings for each of the services you provisioned in the canary tenant
* service-level roles and user licenses for your users
* automations in Orchestrator - You can use the UiPath Orchestrator Manager to copy data from one of your tenants to the canary tenant.


## Editing tenants

When editing tenant settings, you can change the name, color, enable, disable, or delete the tenant.


### Changing the tenant name or color

Go to Admin and select the tenant in the panel on the left.Select Settings.The Settings page for the selected tenant opens.Edit the tenant name if needed.Changing a tenant's name disconnects your Robots and Mobile Orchestrator users, and invalidates any pending user invites. Refer to Impact of Changing Tenant Names.From the list to the right of the name, select a different header color for the tenant, if needed. Select Save Changes at the bottom of the page.

A confirmation message appears in the top right of the screen.Impact of changing tenant namesChanging the name of any of your tenants greatly impacts your previous UiPath service configurations:Robots configured at Orchestrator services level are disconnected. Reconnect your robots, entering the new URLs. Service URLs previously bookmarked don't work anymore. Send your users the new URLs. Mobile Orchestrator users are disconnected. Send them the new service URLs to connect again. User invites sent before the change are not valid anymore. Send new invites for your colleagues who haven’t joined yet.


### Enabling or disabling a tenant

Disabled tenants remain visible to organization administrators in the Tenants panel of the Admin page, but the tenant and its services are no longer available to users. Also, the licenses that were allocated to the tenant are released and returned to the organization's pool of licenses.All data for the services is kept. You can later enable the tenant to access its services again.

Go to Admin and select the tenant in the panel on the left.Select Settings.The Settings page for the selected tenant opens.Under Disable Tenant, select Enable or Disable, depending on the current state of the tenant.A warning dialog opens.In the dialog, select Enable or Disable to proceed.

A loading icon is shown next to the tenant in the Tenants panel on the left while the change is being processed.After the icon disappears:If you disabled the tenant, Disabled appears to its right and the tenant and its services are no longer available to users. If you enabled the tenant, it is now restored as it was before being disabled. All licenses that it used before are also re-allocated if they were available in the organization pool. The tenant and its services are now available for use.


### Moving tenant service data to a different region

To schedule data moves to a new region, contact UiPath Support to request enabling this feature for your cloud organization.


### Deleting a tenant

When deleting a tenant, you remove the tenant from your organization and also delete all of its services and any service data.After deleting a tenant, all its licenses are freed up and available for you to allocate to other tenants.If any processes are being executed in the tenant's Orchestrator service, you cannot delete the tenant.

Go to Admin and select the tenant in the panel on the left.Select Settings.The Settings page for the selected tenant opens.Under Delete permanently, select Delete, depending on the current state of the tenant.The Delete Tenant dialog opens.In the field, enter the tenant name, exactly as it is shown, including the letter case, and then select Delete.

A loading icon is displayed next to the tenant in the Tenants panel while the deletion is in progress. When complete, the tenant is removed from the Tenants panel.


## Editing tenant licenses

In Admin > Tenant > Licenses, you can view information about the licenses currently allocated to each tenant.

To change the license quantities, select Edit allocation in the top right corner.

For more information, refer to Allocating licenses to tenants.
