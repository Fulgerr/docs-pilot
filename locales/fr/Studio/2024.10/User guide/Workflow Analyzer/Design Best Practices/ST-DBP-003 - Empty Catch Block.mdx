# ST-DBP-003 - Empty Catch Block

Rule ID: ST-DBP-003

Scope: Activity

# Description

The rule checks whether exceptions are caught with a purpose, and not only to prevent error messages.

# Recommendation

It is recommended to insert log messages in the Catch block of a Try Catch activity, in addition to the exception handling itself.
