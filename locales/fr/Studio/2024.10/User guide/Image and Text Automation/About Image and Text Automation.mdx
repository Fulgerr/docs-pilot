# About Image and Text Automation

To enable image and text-based process automation, Studio features activities that simulate
                keyboard and mouse input, such as clicking, hovering or typing, text
                recognition and OCR activities that use screen scraping to identify UI
            elements, and image recognition activities that work directly with images to
            identify UI elements. Specialized recording wizards for Screen Scraping and Citrix
            recording can also automatically generate the activities required for each process, as
            explained here.

Image and Text automation is useful in situations when UI automation does not work, such as in virtual machine environments, where selectors cannot be found by using normal methods.

This chapter goes through the most important activities in each type of automation, explaining their behaviour and use cases, and then exemplifying three kinds of image and text-based process automation, using the activities described earlier.
