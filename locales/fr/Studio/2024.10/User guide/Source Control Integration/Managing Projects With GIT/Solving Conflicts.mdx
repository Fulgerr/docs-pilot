# Solving Conflicts

GIT integration with Studio comes with a feature for solving conflicts that may occur when performing the Rebase or Push command, found in the Commit Changes window.

Whenever Studio detects a conflict between the local file and the one found in the remote repository, the Solve conflicts window is displayed.

The window is similar to Workflow Diff, showing the differences between the Remote version of the file and the Local version.
