# Robotic Enterprise Framework

Robotic Enterprise Framework is a project template based on State Machines. It is created to fit all of the best practices regarding logging, exception handling, application initialization, and others, being ready to tackle a complex business scenario.

The template contains several pre-made State containers for initializing applications, retrieving input data, processing it and ending the transaction. All of these States are connected through multiple Transitions which cover almost every need in a standard automation scenario. There are also multiple invoked workflows, each handling particular aspects of the project.

The default dependencies in a Robotic Enterprise Framework project are: UiPath.Excel.Activities, UiPath.System.Activities, and UiPath.UIAutomation.Activities.

The template comes with detailed documentation and examples in the project folder.
