# Introduction

Studio provides specialized tools to integrate testing into the development and
            automation process. Studio allows you to perform both Application and RPA testing. You
            can use Studio to create, design, and map test cases and execution results to
            requirements and defects (e.g. Jira, Xray). You can create your testing portfolio using
            Studio's testing capabilities, which offer two distinct approaches. You can use these
            methods either individually, or in combination:

* Low-code using Test Case -  create and design your test cases through
                a virtual interface with drag-and-drop activities, making it accessible for a broad
                user base.
* Coded using Coded Test Case - create and design your test cases by
                typing code directly within Studio. Visit Introduction to
                    coded automations to learn how to use coded automations.

Moreover, you can leverage generative AI capabilities offered by AutopilotTM , to generate both low-code
            and coded test cases from natural language. You can also generate coded test cases from
            manual test cases, that you have linked from Test Manager. Visit  to learn how to use AI in your test automations.
