# Creating a guided product tour

This tutorial demonstrates how to create a guided product tour, as part of the digital
            adoption attended scenario. This scenario is focused on increasing user productivity,
            experience, and optimize products in general. This tutorial, in particular, shows how to
            create a guided tour for the Wikipedia website.

The steps below show an overview on how to build a guided tour for the Wikipedia
                website:Create a separate workflow for
                    showing the callouts (show callout.xaml). In this workflow you should
                    loop through every step and display it inside the callout. To make the tour
                    experience accurate, configure Advanced Logic on form components.
                    This way you can, for example, disable the Back button when showing the
                    first step of the tour.Create multiple trigger workflows
                    for possible user actions inside the callout, such as:When user clicks
                                Next (click next.xaml)When user clicks
                                Back (click back.xaml)When user clicks
                                Skip (click skip.xaml)When user clicks
                                Finish (click finish.xaml)You can achieve this using the Form trigger activity.In the Main workflow, show
                    a form that welcomes the user and asks if it's ready to start the tour. You can
                    achieve this by building a Form file, and then displaying it using the
                        Show Form activity
                        (welcome.uiform).Create a CSV file that holds all
                    the UI (user interface) elements and the corresponding steps used inside the
                    tour. Separate the information in two columns:Selector - the
                            value of the UI element. You can get the value of a UI element using
                                .Message - the
                            message that you want to indicate next to the UI element.Read the CSV file created at step
                    2 and save it to a global variable. You can achieve this by using the Read
                        CSV activity and the Data Manager panel to create the global
                    variable.To display the number of steps
                    left to complete inside each callout, save the number of steps inside a global
                    variable.When you open the Wikipedia
                    website, invoke show.callout.xaml , and run all local triggers in
                    parallel. This allows you to show the callout for each step, based on the
                    actions a user takes inside a callout.
