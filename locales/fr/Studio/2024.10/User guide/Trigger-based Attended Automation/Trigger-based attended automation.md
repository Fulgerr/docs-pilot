# Trigger-based attended automation

# Introduction

Attended automations are designed to run under human supervision based on input received from humans. Therefore, the actions a user or an application takes are defining for attended automations. Triggers advance attended automations by monitoring whatever action a user or an application takes. In the UiPath attended automation ecosystem, user and application actions are defined as events. Triggers can set off a multitude of events, enabling complex attended automations.

# Benefits

The benefits of the current trigger-based attended automation capabilities are:

* Build highly responsive automations – using triggers for application or form events such as Minimized, or for user events such as Click.
* Work with multiple attended scenarios at the same time – using triggers for multiple application events (Minimized, Restored, Title changed) or user events (Click, Keypress, Hotkey, Mouse) that you can enable at the same time.
* Higher UI (user interface) accuracy and overall performance – using the improved version of the existent capabilities, to better identify UI elements and events.
* Run workflows intermittently – using triggers that you can schedule to either run one time, in sequence, or at the same time.

# Common use cases

Here are a couple of scenarios where you can use the trigger-based attended solution:

* Contact Center: Customer service - for companies where customer service works via phone calls.Sales requests
* Feedback forms
* Survey applications
* Digital Adoption PlatformsFor developing guided tours, to help users navigate through a product, application, or website.For developing custom validation for user input.
