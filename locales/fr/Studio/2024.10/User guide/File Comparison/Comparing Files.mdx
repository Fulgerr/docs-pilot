# Comparing Files

Comparing two similar files in the same automation project is done by using the two context menu options in the Project panel.

Compare Files may be used for comparing differences between two .xaml files, either processes or libraries, as long as they contain similar workflows. The functionality is also available for local copies of versioned files.

In addition, Compare Files can be used for comparing two local or versioned project.json files part of the same project, as well as '.txt' files.

## Using Compare Files

1. In the Project panel, right-click the first file, and in the context menu click Select for Compare . The file is marked for comparison.
2. In the same Project panel, right-click the second file and click Compare with Selected. The second file is selected for comparison and the Compare Files window opens.

The first .xaml selected for comparison is located on the left side of the window, with its path at the top. The second file is featured on the right, together with its location.

Compare Files is also available for files versioned under GIT, SVN, or TFS, allowing you to compare .xaml, project.json, and .txt files part of the same automation project.

Dependency names are arranged alphabetically to aid with the comparing process between the two project.json files.
