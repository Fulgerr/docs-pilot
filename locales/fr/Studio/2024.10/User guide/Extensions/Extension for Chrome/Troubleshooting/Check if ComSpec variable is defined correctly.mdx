# Check if ComSpec variable is defined correctly

# Description

The ChromeNativeMessaging.exe process runs under the current user
                and it uses cmd.exe to start the browser.

If the ComSpec environment variable is missing or has an invalid
                value, then Google Chrome cannot launch the
                    ChromeNativeMessaging.exe.

Furthermore, the administrator may disable the command prompt for some users or
                configure it to always run with elevated privileges.

# Solution

Manually add the correct value for the ComSpec environment variable.
                This variable is set at Windows installation and must be set to:
                    %SystemRoot%\system32\cmd.exe.

# Other workarounds

If the ComSpec environment variable is set correctly but the problem
                persists, the user may not have permission to run the command prompt. In this case,
                the ChromeNativeMessaging.exe process cannot be started with
                    cmd.exe running under the current user.

Starting with Chromium 120.0.6090+, a NativeHostsExecutablesLaunchDirectlyGroup Policy allows admins to turn this on for users in
                restricted environments (Cloud PCs that forbid cmd.exe, for
                    example).
