# About SAP WebGUI Automation

Starting with UiPath.UIAutomation.Activities version 2023.4 and above, we
            introduce a new way of identification and automation of SAP elements of SAP WebGUI. This
            allows stable and reliable identification independent from the dynamical nature of the
            interface.

The entire range of activities from the UiPath.UIAutomation.Activities package can be
            used for SAP WebGUI automation. For some SAP specific controls, we are providing
            additional extended support. Learn more from the  page.

# Identifying SAP WebGUI Elements

SAP WebGUI uses the
                proprietary SAP HTML framework to display its elements on the page. Selectors
                generated for these elements are easy to recognize by
                the sapweb- attributes in selectors.

A set of
                    sapweb attributes allows stable and reliable identification of
                display elements, like SAP WinGUI technical selectors.

A selector for an SAP
                WebGUI element contains the <webctrl> tag, like other web UI
                elements.
