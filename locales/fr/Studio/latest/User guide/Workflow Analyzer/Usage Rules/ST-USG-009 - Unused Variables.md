# ST-USG-009 - Unused Variables

Rule ID: ST-USG-009

Scope: Workflow

# Description

The rule checks whether there are variables defined in the file or project, but unused.

# Recommendation

Remove variables that are not used. Workflows should only have variables that are necessary for its execution. Unused variables make the project more difficult to understand and should be removed. For removing all unused variables, use the button "Remove Unused Variables" in the ribbon, as shown here.
