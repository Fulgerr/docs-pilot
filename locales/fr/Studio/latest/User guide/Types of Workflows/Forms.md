# Forms

In Studio, a Form is a file with a .uiform extension that contains the design and
                                    layout information for creating customized user interfaces using
                                    the Form Builder. When you create a new Form, the
                                                Form Builder opens in the Designer
                                    panel.

The Form Builder is a customized implementation of the form.io engine that allows you to create customized forms for your attended automation workflows. It provides a drag-and-drop interface for designing forms and callouts, which you can then integrate into your projects.

The Form Builder has a variety of form elements available, including text boxes, dropdowns, checkboxes, radio buttons, and more. Users can easily add these elements to their forms and customize them with labels, default values, validation rules, and other properties.



Once a form has been created, you can integrate it in your automations as a form (using the Show Form activity) or as a callout (using the Show Callout activity). You can define triggers for when the form should be displayed, such as when a certain activity is executed or when a specific condition is met. You can also specify what data should be passed between the form and the workflow, enabling bi-directional communication.
