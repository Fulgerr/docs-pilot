# About Control Flow

An important aspect of successfully working with Studio is understanding and knowing how to
            control your project. Control Flow is a concept borrowed from computer science
            that refers to the order in which actions are performed in an automation.

A proper Control Flow can be achieved through the intelligent use of variables and activities.

All of these activities can be found in the Activities panel, under Workflow > Control.

These activities enable you to define rules and automate conditional statements within the project, through if/else and for each statements or loops.Delay can also be added between actions, in order to perfectly time activities.

Loops represent an important part of automations as they enable you to easily check dependencies between variables, activities and conditions. Once created, they enable the user to run a segment of the automation for a specific number of times, until a condition is met, or indefinitely.
