# About SAP WinGUI

Enabling SAP WinGUI API scripting allows you to create reliable automations for the SAP WinGUI. Studio and Robots require SAP WinGUI scripting to be enabled on the local machine as well as on the server side. Before you can create your first automation projects for SAP, you need to go over the configuration steps.

UI elements in SAP are known as controls, and you might need a particular approach or activity to detect and use them. Find out more about supported SAP elements.

# SAP WinGUI Additional Information

Wildcards and Regular expressions can be used inside selectors generated for SAP WinGUI elements.

SAP WinGUI selectors support for the identification purpose not only technical ID, but also Text, Tooltip and Type of SAP control attributes.  Complex SAP controls such as SAP Tables, SAP Grids and SAP Trees do not have these attributes available, as identification is done differently.

In case SAP WinGUI API scripting is not activated or not allowed in your organization, you can interact with the SAP WinGUI interface with help of Computer Vision activities.

# SAP WinGUI Scripting Notification

When SAP WinGUI cannot be automated through SAP API Scripting due to misconfiguration or incomplete configuration, the below error message is displayed:

![bef7eb2-SAP_Notification_Example=GUID-365712D3-FCC1-44CA-B5BC-5FDCDBD285CB=1=en=Default](/images/bef7eb2-SAP_Notification_Example=GUID-365712D3-FCC1-44CA-B5BC-5FDCDBD285CB=1=en=Default.png)

Please follow the configuration steps to verify and to correct the settings.

# Enforce hard timeout

The Enforce hard timeout setting can be
                                                  found in Project Settings > UI
                                                  Automation Classic > SAP. If the
                                                  setting is set to True, the Robot
                                                  terminates the SAP activity execution and it
                                                  throws an error after the timeout specified in the
                                                  activity target. You can catch and handle the
                                                  error message in a Try Catch
                                                  activity. By default, the setting is set to
                                                  False.

This setting is useful in cases when you might
                                                  want to end a long running SAP activity, or when
                                                  SAP becomes stuck or unresponsive, or network or
                                                  connection issues arise.

# Elevation level

Elevation level determines whether an application
                                                  is running with user permissions or with
                                                  administrator permissions, the latter allowing you
                                                  to perform more powerful tasks.

The elevation level for UiPath Studio and SAP
        needs to match. If there is an elevation level mismatch between these applications, the
        automation is not possible.
