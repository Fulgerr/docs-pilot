# 2024.10.5

Release date: 21 October 2024

## What's New

# New Autopilot™ features

You can now generate workflows from empty sequences (including the main
                                sequence) by selecting the new Generate with Autopilot
                                button. This creates a new annotation, where you can type in your
                                instructions and select Generate to create your
                                        workflow.

Autopilot can also generate activity output variables which are then
                                automatically used in subsequent activities (for example, Autopilot
                                will use the output variable generated for a Create Event activity in the
                                        Event field of a Forward Event activity).

The new Autopilot panel makes the development process more
                                accessible and efficient.

The panel allows you to use Autopilot™ to summarize your workflow and
                                generate workflows from a centralized interface. The panel also
                                improves error handling and troubleshooting by providing AI-based
                                suggestions for resolving both low-code and coded workflow errors,
                                including errors identified by Workflow Analyzer rules.
                                Additionally, you can use Autopilot to search the entire UiPath
                                documentation directly from the panel. To learn more, see The
                                        Autopilot Panel.

# New Workflow Analyzer
                                rules

Two new Workflow Analyzer rules are now
                                available to help with migrating projects from the Windows - Legacy
                                to the Windows compatibility.

# Coded automations features

Workflow Analyer rules for code

We have introduced two new Workflow Analyzer rules:ST-DPB-010: Make sure that
                                                within any coded workflow or test case, only one
                                                method is marked with either the
                                                  [Workflow] or [Test
                                                  Case] attribute.ST-NMG-017: Ensures that a
                                                class name is distinct from the default
                                                namespace.Erratum - Added October 30, 2024: ST-REL-001: Ensures that the
                                                argument types of In/Out parameters are
                                                matching.

XML documentation file for your custom code and libraries

You can now access XML documentation files after you
                                publish a project and enjoy the benefit of code documentation for
                                your custom code and libraries. After the project is published, the
                                        XML files are generated alongside the
                                        DLL and PDB files in your
                                project folder. You can also find them in the lib folder of the
                                generated NUPKG file. Visit Working with Coded automations to learn
                                more about publishing projects that contain coded automations.

Erratum - Added October 30, 2024: Modify arguments as
                                        properties for coded automations in libraries

You can now seamlessly adjust the properties of a coded automation reused
                                as an invoked workflow through the properties present in the body of
                                the activity. This applies when you export a coded automation to a
                                library, install that library into another project, and invoke the
                                coded automation within your current XAML workflow. In invoked
                                workflow added as an activity, modify the available properties of
                                the invoked coded automation as needed.

Additionally, inside the library project, you can also configure the
                                layout of an activity from the Activity Properties window.
                                Configuring the activity properties before exporting the coded
                                automation involves editing options such as the Display Name,
                                        Tooltip, or Help Link.

Erratum - Added October 30, 2024: Declaring In/Out arguments
                                        using Output

You can now declare an In/Out argument by naming it
                                        Output. Naming any argument as
                                        Output treats it as an In/Out argument,
                                even if it's only declared once in the method. For more information
                                about using arguments in coded automations, visit .

# Test automation features

XBrowser Test Template

Streamline your testing processes of websites and web applications by
                                using the XBrowser Test Template. This template allows you to test
                                the same test data of a web application with multiple browsers, all
                                into one single automation. Visit  for more information.

Generating low-code test cases using AI

You can now generate a fully automated low-code test case using natural
                                language, with the help of AutopilotTM. Visit Generating test cases using AI to check
                                how to generate low-code test cases.


## Improvements

# Improved save to the cloud
                experience

We have made several improvements to the way in which you can manage cloud projects.

When a cloud project is edited in Studio Web, you can only open it in Studio in
                read-only mode (the project cannot be opened in edit mode both in Studio Web and
                Studio).

Studio now informs you every time you lose editing access (for example, when the
                project is edited by someone else or the cloud connection is lost), to avoid
                possible future conflicts when trying to save the project.

A message in the Project panel tells you that the project is locked for
                editing, and an Edit Here button lets you modify the project in Studio. The
                editing session then moves to the current Studio instance. You can also gain editing
                access to the project when you close the other instance of the project in Studio
                Web.

When a project is saved in a different location on your machine, you now have the
                option to either unlink the project from the cloud or use the new local path to the
                project.

When you open a project, Studio automatically detects if you manually moved the
                project to a different location on your machine, and your input is not needed.

If you manually copy the project to a different location on your machine, you now
                have the option to either unlink the project from the cloud or use the new local
                path to the project.

Lastly, local and cloud projects are now clearly labeled as such in the Studio
                    Backstage.

# State machine improvements

Building on the improvements announced for flowcharts, we are excited to bring you an
                updated state machine experience, which includes:New designs for the Start, State, and Final nodes.An infinite canvas Designer panel, with a new grid system to better
                        position your activities.Improvements to the design and functionality of activities and connectors,
                        complete with support for adding annotations.

# Improved Expression Editor

We have improved the design and functionality of the Expression Editor. Some changes
                include: Fixing line spacing and text
                        alignment.  Improving the layout of the
                            Fix and Use Variables buttons.  Adding dedicated Undo
                        and Redo buttons.

# Coded automations improvements

* The following keyboard shortcuts now allow you to expand or reduce your current code selection as follows:Ctrl + Shift + <Num+: Expand your current code selection to include the next larger syntax node. From the current line, you can expand to include the current block, then the current method, the current class, the namespace, and finally the entire file.Ctrl + <Shift + Num-: Contract the current syntax node selection incrementally.
* You can now record your interactions with UI elements and translate them into coded automations.

# Test automation improvements

AI-generated test data improvements

* When using Autopilot for generating test data, you can instruct it to introduce additional arguments, which will be included in the test case once you import the generated data set.
* Now, you initially offer a prompt instruction to Autopilot to get a primary test data set. This is a change from the previous behavior where Autopilot initially created a test data set that you were able to refine using prompt instructions.
* You can instruct Autopilot to generate a certain number of data variations.

Improved error messages for Postman integration

We've made improvements to the API Test Automation. Error messages from the Postman
                integration are now more clearly displayed in the user interface.

Converting text into code improvements

You can now turn text into code by selecting the Autopilot icon or by choosing the
                existent Generate Code action.

# Installation and upgrade

The
                            UiPathStudio.msi installer no longer supports the
                            Packages command line feature flag . This does not
                        impact the installation process, as the feature flag was kept for backward
                        compatibility and had no real function.UiPathStudio.msi does not support direct upgrade from
                        Studio 2018.4 or lower. Upgrading from such a version must be done through
                        an intermediary upgrade to the latest 24.10 patch.

# Other improvements

* Optimized compile times for complex projects including low-code and coded test cases, execution templates, and entities.
* You can now improve the alignment of flowchart nodes and connectors in the Designer panel by using the Auto arrange context menu option. You can choose to make your flowcharts more readable by arranging them either horizontally or vertically.
* Project validation is now faster.
* GIT integration in Studio now supports Schannel.
* The Dictionary Builder now supports complex expressions both in the Key and Value fields. You can also switch between the Expression Editor and the Dictionary Builder in activity properties that only used the Dictionary builder.
* You can now add a top level annotation to the main sequence of a project by right-clicking the Designer panel and selecting Annotations > Add Annotation. The main sequence is now hidden by default.
* We have improved the message you see in the Manage Packages window when you select an activities package that is not compatible with your project.
* The Project Dependencies Mass Update Tool now has an Install Missing Package option for updating dependencies which are already part of projects or installing dependencies in projects that do not contain them.
* To reduce the size of published packages, .git and .svn folders are now excluded from the resulting NUPKG file.
* Several performance improvements have been made to RAM usage.


## Breaking Changes

Coded Automations

To avoid conflicts when you use connections from the same Orchestrator folders, you now
            need to use a different naming convention when establishing connections in coded
            automations. After you create the connection in Integration Service, call it in your
            coded automation using both the Orchestrator folder and subfolder name where the
            connection resides.

This doesn't change anything for your Integration Service connections. But, you must
            manually change the name of the connection that you have set in your coded automations.
            For instance, if you have an automation where you have a connection similar to this one:
                var myGmailConnection =
                connections.Gmail.My_Workspace_john_doe_gmail_com, where
                My_Workspace is the Orchestrator folder name, you now need to
            include the subfolder name where the connection was first made. So if the Gmail
            connection is in the My Gmail Workspace subfolder, you would change the
            connection name to: var myGmailConnection =
                connections.Gmail.My_Workspace_My_Gmail_Workspace_john_doe_gmail_com.

                .

Studio Logs

Fatal severity logs appear as Trace logs in the
                Output panel and are filtered as Trace logs when clicking
            the Trace button
            in the panel’s header.


## Bug Fixes

* While debugging a XAML workflow within a project that contained CS files, an
                'Unexpected error during library compilation: Value cannot be null. (Parameter
                'type')' error occurred, which caused the compilation to fail.
* A Root element is missing error occurred when publishing some background processes.
* Some projects with missing
                dependencies were incorrectly reported as published when using the Project
                    Dependencies Mass Update Tool .
* Studio logged Bad IL format compilation errors when running some projects migrated from Windows - Legacy. These
                errors did not affect project execution.
* Unused dependencies were not
                correctly identified when analyzing some projects migrated from Windows -
                Legacy.
* Compilation failed for some projects
                where the combined length of user strings exceeded the allowed limit.
* Renaming a project caused invalid
                references in projects with XAML files referencing code assemblies.
* When creating custom activities using
                code, the UiPath.Workflow 6.0.0-20231211-03 package led to a version conflict with
                Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Common. The solution involved adding a previously missing
                dependency.
* Publishing some projects with missing
                dependencies in a GitHub CI/CD pipeline did not return validation errors.
* The ST-NMG-004 - Display Name Duplication rule incorrectly
                detected repetitive activities names.
* The Locals panel did not
                display any information when debugging some projects saved on a network drive.
* Elastic Robot Pools were not
                displayed in the Machine drop-down menu when configuring an Unattended Robot
                remote debugging connection.
* Studio incorrectly detected workflow
                changes when debugging some projects using Step Into .
* The Text Builder showed a
                non-functional Plus button in cross-platform projects.
* Multiple BC31424 and BC30652 validation errors occurred when trying to publish some projects
                created in earlier versions of Studio.
* Publishing some projects that
                contained a large number of test cases (200+) took longer than expected.
* Compiling some projects containing a
                large number of workflows (1000+) took longer than expected.
* Erratum - added February 10, 2025 : A Collection was modified; enumeration
                    operation may not execute error occurred when opening some projects from a
                shared drive.


## Known Issues

* Application tracking does not work for
                applications used in libraries.
* When working with coded workflows or
                test cases, an error can occur. If you attempt to create arguments of any type
                (including In, Out, and In/Out) with certain names such as result , newResult , codedWorkflow and isolated , you may encounter a compilation error.


## Activity package versions

The following activity packages and versions are
            included in the UiPathStudio.msi installer and can be found in the
            local feed.
