# Creating a Basic Process

This tutorial teaches you how to create a basic process in Studio in 10 minutes and run it on your machine. The example opens a browser, loads a certain web page, scrapes information, and writes it to the Output panel, and in a Notepad file.

Launch Studio. In the HOME Backstage view, click Process to create a new project. The New Blank Process window is displayed.In the New Blank Process window:Enter a name for the new project and a description that summaries what you are aiming to do with this automation project.The project name cannot exceed 128 characters, and the description cannot exceed 500 characters.Select Show advanced options and choose the location where to create the project. Select Windows for the Compatibility option and VB for Language.Click Create. The new project is opened in Studio.Open Internet Explorer and navigate to https://www.uipath.com/product/studio. You can use any supported browser, but make sure the required UiPath extension is installed.In the Activities panel, search for Use Application/Browser and drag it to the Designer panel. Notice that the activity is automatically added inside a Sequence.  In Use Application/Browser, click Indicate application to automate, and then move the mouse pointer to the browser page you just opened. When the window is highlighted, click anywhere in the browser page.The Use Application/Browser activity is updated, the URL is added to the Browser URL field, and a screenshot of the window appears inside the activity.From the Activities panel, add a Get Text activity to the Do container of the Use Application/Browser activity. Click Indicate in IE, and click on the text that you want to scrape from the previously loaded web page. In the Variables panel, create a new string variable called GetText, and set its scope to Sequence. The purpose of this variable is to store the scraped information.In the Get Text activity, insert the GetText variable in the Save to field.From the Activities panel, drag a Write Line activity. In the input text field, add the previously created variable. This activity writes the scraped data to the Output panel.Add another Use Application/Browser activity to the project. Open a Notepad instance, click Indicate application to automate, and then move the mouse pointer to the Notepad window you just opened. When the window is highlighted, click anywhere inside it.The Use Application/Browser activity is updated, the path is added to the Application path field, and a screenshot of the window appears inside the activity.Add a Type Into activity in the Use Application/Browser activity’s Do container. Click Indicate in App to select the Notepad window, and add the GetText variable to the Type this field. This activity writes the scraped text to a Notepad window.In the ribbon, click Run File or use the Ctrl + F6 shortcut to execute the project.

When the execution is completed, notice that the scraped text is written to the Output panel, and in the Notepad file.Similarly, you can create other processes to scrape data from web pages, using the Table Extraction wizard.Download example
