# ST-USG-010 - Unused Dependencies

Rule ID: ST-USG-010

Scope: Project

# Description

The rule finds and lists unused activities packages in the project. Please note that sub-dependencies are taken into account, if an activity from a sub-dependency is used in the project, then the rule considers the top-level dependency in use as well. This is particularly visible in the case of libraries installed as dependencies, as they may include a set of sub-dependencies.

# Recommendation

Remove unused packages in order to improve process execution time.
