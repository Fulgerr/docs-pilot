Various display issues may occur in Studio if the Nahimic Service
                        software in installed on your machine. This component is also included in
                        other third-party applications such as Asus ROG Xonar Phoebus Sonic Studio
                        and Asus Sonic Studio. We recommend disabling the Nahimic service in Windows
                        or renaming the file NahimicOSD.dll.1 - When using unattended robots on Virtual Machines, do
                        not leave the Azure Virtual Desktop sessions in
                            disconnected state (user is connected to a host pool
                            in an AVD environment, but they are still connected to the session
                            hosts). The robot is not able to use the disconnected session as it
                        was created via AVD and does not have access to it. Because of this, it
                        attempts to create a new session to run the unattended job, but fails
                        because the AVD session is already created and in
                            disconnected state. When this scenario happens, the job
                        eventually fails due to a time out.
