# Introduction

UiPath Studio encapsulates both simple and complex solutions for application integration and
      automating third-party applications, administrative IT tasks, and business IT processes.

Studio is at the heart of automation with UiPath products. Activities form into comprehensive workflows in Studio, which are then
      executed by the Robot and published to Orchestrator.

Introduction to UiPath Studio

Studio comes with two types of profiles for developers and business users:

* Studio offers a plethora of tools
        for designing complex attended, unattended, and testing automations. Studio also supports
        both low-code and coded automations: Low-code automations use a
            visual interface with drag-and-drop activities, making it accesible for a broad user
            base.Coded automations allow you to
            create automations using code, which is ideal for more complex and collaborative
            projects. These automations use UiPath services (which are the equivalent of activity
            packages), coded automation APIs (similar to activities), external .NET NuGet packages,
            and your custom C# classes within Studio.
* StudioX enables business users
          with little or no coding experience to automate their tasks. Check out the StudioX guide.
