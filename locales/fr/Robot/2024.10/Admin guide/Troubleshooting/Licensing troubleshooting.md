# 1900

Error message: No more <License Name> robots available.

Connection status: Connected but unable to retrieve a license.

# 1905

Error message: Update Failed: Please Disconnect Some Machines To Match The Number Of Defined Licenses.

Connection status: -

Potential issue: There is a mismatch between the updated license and the license Orchestrator expects. For example, upon updating the license, from a total of ten runtimes in the license, the user transfers five from Unattended to Citizen Developer. However, Orchestrator expects 10 available runtimes, and thus, this error occurs.

Solutions:

Remove the existing license, select the Activate Online option, then provide the license code again.Remove the unattended robot from the Robots page in Orchestrator, then on the Licenses page in Orchestrator, select the Update option. This updates all runtimes.

# 1908

Error message: Please remove some Development Robots to match the number of defined licenses.

Connection status: -

Potential issue: This error occurs when updating the license, if the number of the available runtimes does not match the active runtimes.

Solution: Remove the active runtimes from their users, update the license, then allocate runtimes back to users, based on the updated license offer.
