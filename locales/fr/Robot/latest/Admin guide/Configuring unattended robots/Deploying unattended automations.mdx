# Deploying unattended automations

Unattended automations are used for tasks that do not require human supervision, usually run in virtual environments on dedicated machines, and are controlled from Orchestrator.

An unattended automation can be started manually from Orchestrator when needed, but can also be scheduled if the task has to start at a specific interval (daily, hourly, weekly) or at a specific time and date (end of week).

To run an unattended automation:

1. Set up the infrastructure.
2. Set up Orchestrator.
3. Connect the robot to Orchestrator.
4. Execute the unattended automation.
