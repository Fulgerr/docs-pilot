# About the MailerLite activities

MailerLite is an email marketing tool allowing users to create, send, track, and optimize email campaigns and newsletters.



To learn more about the MailerLite activities, see the Activities page for a complete list and descriptions.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and MailerLite, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for MailerLite. Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.

Once established, the connection to the MailerLite instance can be used in all activities of the package.
