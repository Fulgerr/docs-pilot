# Insert Record

UiPath.MicrosoftDynamicsCRM.IntegrationService.Activities.InsertRecord

The Insert Record activity uses the default Microsoft Dynamics CRM connection to insert a new record.

After inserting the record, the activity outputs the status of the request (success/failure information) in a ResponseStatus object that you can use in subsequent activities (e.g., conditional logic).

If the request is successful, the activity returns the String identifier assigned to the new record.
