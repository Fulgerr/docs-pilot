# About the PDFMonkey activities

PDFMonkey is an app that automates PDF generation, provides a dashboard to manage templates, and provides a simple API to generate documents.



To learn more about the PDFMonkey activities, see the Activities page for a complete list and descriptions.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and PDFMonkey, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for PDFMonkey. Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.

Once established, the connection to the PDFMonkey instance can be used in all activities of the package.
