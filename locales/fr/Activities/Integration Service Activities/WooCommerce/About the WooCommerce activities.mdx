# About the WooCommerce activities

WooCommerce is an open-source flexible software solution built for WordPress-based websites. It's commonly used to create fully functioning online stores with all the necessary e-commerce features.



To learn more about the WooCommerce activities, see the Activities page for a complete list and descriptions.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and WooCommerce, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for WooCommerce. Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.

Once established, the connection to the WooCommerce instance can be used in all activities of the package.
