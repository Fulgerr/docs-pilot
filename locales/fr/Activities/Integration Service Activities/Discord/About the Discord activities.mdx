# About the Discord activities

Discord is an instant messaging and VoIP social platform which allows communication thorough voice calls, video calls, text messaging, and media and files. Communication can be private or take place in virtual communities called servers.



To learn more about the Discord activities, see the Activities page for a complete list and descriptions.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Discord, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Discord. Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.

Once established, the connection to the Discord instance can be used in all activities of the package.
