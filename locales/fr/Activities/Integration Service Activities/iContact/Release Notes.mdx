### Support for long-running workflows

This connector now supports long-running workflows through the Wait for an Event and
                Resume activity. Its purpose is to suspend a job at runtime and resume the job
            whenever a certain event occurs.

## October 7, 2024

Erratum – Added December 3, 2024: The HTTP Request activity was
            mistakenly announced before it was made available.

# HTTP Request activity

A new HTTP Request activity is now available, allowing you to go beyond the
                predefined activities in a given package and make requests to any endpoint of a
                vendor's API.

HTTP Request reuses the connector pre-configuration and provides transparency
                of headers, authentication, and query parameters. You can reuse any of your
                connections, and provide the endpoint and the JSON payload. Use this
                connector-specific HTTP Request activity to benefit from Integration
                Service's capabilities for connection management.

# New Features and
                Improvements

The iContact activities pack is no longer in preview, as this version marks the first
                official release.

This activity pack is now always displayed in the Available section of the
                Activities panel in Studio. Any activity in this package can be installed by simply
                dragging and dropping it into the canvas. Also, a cloud versioning model is used
                from now on for this package, as updates will be done automatically to the
                activities, without the neccesity of manually updating the package by using the
                    Package Manager.

Please note that from this version onwards, this activity pack is only compatible
                    with Studio v2023.10 and above.
