# About the Google Speech-to-Text activities

Google Speech-to-Text enables the transformation of any audio into text format.



To learn more about the Google Speech-to-Text activities, see the Activities page for a complete list and descriptions.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Google Speech-to-Text, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Speech-to-Text. Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.

Once established, the connection to the Google Speech-to-Text instance can be used in all activities of the package.
