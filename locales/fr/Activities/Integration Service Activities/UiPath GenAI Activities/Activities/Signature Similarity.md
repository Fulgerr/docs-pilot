# Signature Similarity

# Description

Analyze and compare two signature images to determine their similarity, providing a
                detailed analysis and a numerical similarity score.

# Project compatibility

Windows | Cross-platform

# Configuration

* 
* First signature - First signature image to be compared. This field supports IResource type input.
* Second signature - Second signature image to be compared. This field supports IResource type input.

Supported file formats: PNG (.png), JPEG (.jpeg and
                    .jpg).









* Similarity score - A score between 0 and 100 indicating the similarity of the signatures. 0: Completely different or not signatures.50: Some similarities but significant differences.100: Identical or near-identical signatures.
* Reasoning - The explanation of how the conclusion was reached.
* Signature similarity object - Automatically generated output variable.

# Limitations and other considerations

The GPT-4 models have certain
                        limitations when working with images. See the OpenAI Platform documentation
                        to learn more: Limitations. The quality of uploaded images may affect the system's accuracy. The system can provide
                        valuable insights, but it should not be considered a replacement for expert
                        human analysis in critical situations. Consider incorporating an Action
                        Center task for a human-in-the-loop. To ensure privacy and security, the system does not store or retain uploaded
                        signature images.
