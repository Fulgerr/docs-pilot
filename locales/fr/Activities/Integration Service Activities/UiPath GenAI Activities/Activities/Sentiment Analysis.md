# Limitations and other considerations

The complexity and length of the input text may affect the accuracy of
                            the analysis.The system may have difficulties with highly context-dependent or
                            culturally specific expressions.Sarcasm, irony, and other forms of figurative language may pose
                            challenges for accurate sentiment detection.The system's performance may vary across different languages or
                            dialects.
