# Web Summary

# Description

Web Summary provides an AI-generated summary of search results, synthesizing
                key insights from multiple sources and including citations. The summary and source
                citations are available in the output.

Web Summary offers near-real-time search results.
                    Note that time-sensitive data, like stock prices or weather, may be retrieved
                    with a lag of up to several days. You can provide date, time and/or location as
                    arguments in the query if needed, but the engine may still return delayed
                    information.
