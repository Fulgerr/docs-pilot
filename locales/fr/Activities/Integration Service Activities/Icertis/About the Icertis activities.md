# About the Icertis activities

Icertis is a contract management platform that centralizes and streamlines the creation, execution, and management of contracts for businesses.



To learn more about the Icertis activities, see the Activities page for a complete activity list.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Icertis, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Icertis. Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.

From the Icertis Contract Intelligence (ICI) Platform perspective, objects, such as suppliers, payment turns, purchase items, and other master data are highly dynamic. Moreover, objects and fields are customized to each Icertis instance. This is why this activity package contains only standard activities: Insert Record, Update Record, and List All Records. This allows you to work with your specific ICI objects.
