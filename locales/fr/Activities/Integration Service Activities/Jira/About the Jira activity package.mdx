# About the Jira activity package

Jira is a cloud-based issue tracking and project management
                                                platform. After connecting, automate issue creation
                                                and assignment, status updates, and agile processes
                                                across multiple projects and boards.



To learn more about the Jira activities, see the Activities page for a complete list and details.
      For additional information, see Working with Jira activities.

If you're using a version of
        the Jira activity package that does not support the Integration Service, you can access its
        documentation in the Classic Integrations Activities guide.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Jira, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Jira.

Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.
