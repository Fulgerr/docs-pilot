# Configuration

Issue ID or key - The
                        issue you wish to update. Enter the full issue key, such as
                            ABCD-1234, or the issue ID. You can also use the
                        dropdown list to search for an issue. This field supports
                            String type input.Assignee user ID -
                        Start typing the user's email. This field supports String
                        type input. Once you provide input for the Issue ID or key field, a
                        list of assignees becomes available in the dropdown list. If you don't
                        provide an assignee, the issue remains unassigned.





# How it works

The Update Issue Assignee activity does three things:

1. Replaces an existing assignee.
2. Adds an assignee if the issue was unassigned.
3. Removes an assignee.

The Assignee user ID look-up doesn't load any assignees unless you select an
                issue key. For details, see the User Assignable API.

If you want to update assignees of different issues, you can use a variable for the
                    Issue field and keep the Assignee field intact.
