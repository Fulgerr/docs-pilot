# About the Box activities

Box is a cloud-based content management and file sharing platform. After connecting, you can automate the entire content lifecycle-creating and sharing new files, collaborative editing, signature gathering, and more.

To learn more about the Box activities, see the Activities page for a complete list and details.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Box, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Box.

Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.
