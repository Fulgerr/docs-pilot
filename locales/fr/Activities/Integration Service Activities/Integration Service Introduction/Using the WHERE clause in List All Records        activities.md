# Using the WHERE clause in List All Records
        activities

# Overview

UiPath uses a generic pattern for activities such as List All Records in
                Integration Service activities. In List All Records, a Where
                clause is available to allow for more advanced filtering.

Not all List All Records activities include a Where
                        property. Availability depends on each connector. Older versions of Integration Service activity packages may also include
                            List Record activities. List Record has been deprecated
                        and replaced with List All Records. We recommend you always use the
                        latest package version available.

# Using the WHERE property

The Where clause, or the CEQL search expression, provides a standard
                way to search across records. The Where clause specifies what to
                search and what objects to return in our result set.

A Where clause has three components:

The left­hand side (LHS) element of the conditionThe operatorThe right­hand side (RHS) element of the condition

Add a List All Records activity to your workflow.Select the object from the dropdown menu.Use the Manage Properties option to view any additional fields
                            available for the selected object. These may include: Max
                                        records - Defines the maximum number of records to
                                    return.Order by
                                    or Sort by- The order in which results should be
                                    sorted.Where -
                                    The CEQL search expression, or the where clause, without the
                                        WHERE keyword, in a typical SQL query.
