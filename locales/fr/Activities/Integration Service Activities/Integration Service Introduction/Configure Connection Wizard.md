# Configure Connection Wizard

This page discusses the difference between robot connections and design connections.

This page refers only to
            Studio connections in older versions of activity packages. The latest version of
            Integration Service activities, available through UiPath.IntegrationService.Activities,
            uses one connection. Studio Web also has only a single connection that is used for both
            design time and run time (robot).

The Robot Connection is the connection used when the process executes or runs.

The Design Connection is used only at the design time of a process in Studio when you are configuring the activities and they need to connect to the remote service to get a list of objects or object properties. It is also used with the Get Sample Data and Test Sample Data features on certain activities.

You can choose the same connection for run time and design time, which is the default behavior:

However, there are times when these may need to be different, where you want to use one connection for run time (robot) and another one for design time.

This is particularly useful when you want the robot to run under a service account but you need your personal account to access design time properties.

On your process, you can only have one robot connection for a given connector (e.g. Salesforce). However, since the design connection is not used when the robot is running, you can set it to the whichever account you need.

Regardless of the robot connection you specify, this value can be overridden if a robot (process) is started from UiPath Assistant or UiPath Orchestrator.

In case you have created multiple connections, you can select from the drop-down which connection to use, besides the default one, both for robot connection and for design connection.

Not all Integration Service activities packages support the ability to select a connection to use in the Configure Connection Wizard. To see if the feature is supported or not, check out the release notes of the package you want to use.
