# Process Tracking Service support

Integration Service
        activities support Process Tracking Service only when the automation containing them has the
            Process tracking option enabled.

When you use multiple automations to implement an end-to-end business process, the following
      behaviors occur:

# Task ID generation

Task generation: When an automation, for example, A1, is suspended and waits for an
        external event to complete before resuming. This could mean a different automation to be
        fully executed, processing queue items, or waiting for an third-party application task to
        complete. The behavior occurs for all persistence activities, which are the ones that start
        with Wait for.

The following table summarizes the Wait for an
          Event and Resume activities that generate new task IDs:

                    executed before resuming.<ActivityNameInStudio>: refers to the name of the Integration Service
                    persistence activity set in Studio at design time.Task start timestamp: when automation A1 suspends.Task end timestamp: when automation A1 resumes.

# Object tracking

Object tracking: When an automation, for example, A1, creates an object O1 via Integration
        Service "Create" activities, it tracks its progress through automation A2 using the O1
          Object type and Object ID properties. Exceptions are the "Read" or "List"
        activities.

Each Integration Service "Create" activity adds the tracking for their
        object as follows:

* Object type: <IntegrationServiceObject>, for example, "Account"
* Object ID: <System Object ID>, for example, "0010700000gMXRqAAO"
* Object interaction: <Based on the activity used>, for example, "Create", "Update", or "Delete"
* Object properties:{ XUiPathConnectorKey: "<XUiPathConnectorKey>", // for example, XUiPathConnectorKey: "uipath-salesforce-sfdc" XUiPathConnectorName: "<XUiPathConnectorName>", // for example, XUiPathConnectorName: "Salesforce" XUiPathObjectDisplayName: "<XUiPathObjectDisplayName>", // for example, XUiPathObjectDisplayName: "Account" XUiPathObjectName: "<XUiPathObjectName>" // for example, XUiPathObjectName: "curated_account" }
