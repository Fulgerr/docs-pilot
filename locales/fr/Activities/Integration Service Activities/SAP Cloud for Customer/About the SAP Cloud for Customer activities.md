# About the SAP Cloud for Customer activities

SAP Cloud for customer (C4C) is a cloud CRM that enables sales representatives to interact with customers in more meaningful ways and develop strong personal connections that allow for improved engagement across all the communication channels.

To learn more about the SAP activities, see the Activities page for a complete activity list and links to the activity detail pages.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and SAP, the activities establish an authenticated connection via the SAP Cloud for Customer Connector. Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.
