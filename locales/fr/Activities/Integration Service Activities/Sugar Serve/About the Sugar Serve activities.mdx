# About the Sugar Serve activities

Sugar Serve offers automation of customer support processes and puts everything agents need to work a support case right at their fingertips, in an integrated and optimized console experience.

The activities give your UiPath robot(s) the ability to manage your records (get, update, insert, list and delete).

To learn more about the Sugar Serve activities, see the Activities page for a complete activity list and links to the activity detail pages.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Sugar Serve, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Sugar Serve.

Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.
