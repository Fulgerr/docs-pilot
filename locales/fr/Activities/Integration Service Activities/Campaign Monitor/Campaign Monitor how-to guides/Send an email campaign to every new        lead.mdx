# Send an email campaign to every new
        lead

Applications Used: Salesforce and Campaign Monitor

# Description

A lead in Salesforce can be anyone from a potential customer to a partner. In
                order to qualify the lead or prospect the lead further so that it converts/generates
                into an opportunity or a customer account, it can be pulled into existing/new email
                campaigns by Sales/Marketing teams. Also, if the score of lead changes, more
                customized email campaigns can be sent.

This workflow uses Campaign Monitor activities such as Add Subscriber, Create Campaign, and Send Campaign, along with the
                Salesforce event Lead created.
