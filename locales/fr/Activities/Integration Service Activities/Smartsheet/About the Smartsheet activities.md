# About the Smartsheet activities

Smartsheet is a web-based spreadsheet program. You can create and manage data in spreadsheets and CSVs, assign tasks, track project progress, share documents and manage other work, using a tabular user interface.



To learn more about the Smartsheet activities, see the Activities page for a complete list and descriptions.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Smartsheet, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Smartsheet.

Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.
