# About the Slack activities

Slack is an enterprise collaboration hub that brings the right people, information, and tools together to get work done. By using workspaces and channels, Slack enables cross-functional and cross-departmental teams to communicate, share files, and make decisions all in one location.

The activity package for Slack gives you the ability to manage your Slack channels (create, invite users, remove users), messages, and records (get, update, insert, list and delete).

To learn more about the Slack integrations, see the Activities page for a complete activity list and links to the activity detail pages.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Slack, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Slack.

Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.
