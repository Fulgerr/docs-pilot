# Release Notes


## March 11, 2025

Due to recent API deprecations announced by Slack, we have updated the Slack activities
            to ensure continued functionality and compliance. The Send File to Channel
            activity now uses the files.getUploadURLExternal and
                files.completeUploadExternal APIs. The two APIs replace the
            deprecated files.upload API.

### Support for long-running workflows

This connector now supports long-running workflows through the Wait for an Event and
                Resume activity. Its purpose is to suspend a job at runtime and resume the job
            whenever a certain event occurs.

# HTTP Request activity

A new HTTP Request activity is now available, allowing you to go beyond the
                predefined activities in a given package and make requests to any endpoint of a
                vendor's API.

HTTP Request reuses the connector pre-configuration and provides transparency
                of headers, authentication, and query parameters. You can reuse any of your
                connections, and provide the endpoint and the JSON payload. Use this
                connector-specific HTTP Request activity to benefit from Integration
                Service's capabilities for connection management.
