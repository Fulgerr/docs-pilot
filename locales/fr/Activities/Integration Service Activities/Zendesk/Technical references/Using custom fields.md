# Using custom fields

Known limitationCurrently the mandatory custom
                fields don't show up directly on the activity canvas. They need to be accessed from
                    Manage Properties. This issue will be fixed in a later release, and the
                required fields, either standard or custom, will appear directly on the
                canvas.You can set up custom fields for an activity using the Manage
                Properties wizard.

Select the chechbox for the desired fields to include them on an activity's canvas, then
            click Update fields.

The selected fields will be visible under Additional options.
