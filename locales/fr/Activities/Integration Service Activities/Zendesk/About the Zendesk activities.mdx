# About the Zendesk activities

Zendesk is a cloud-based help desk management solution offering customizable tools to build customer service portal, knowledge base and online communities. The solution offers a customizable front-end portal, live chat features and integration with applications like Salesforce and Google Analytics. Zendesk allows you to manage your incidents, priorities, statuses, users, etc. across multiple Help Desk Elements.

# Zendesk activity package

The activities give your UiPath robot(s) the ability to manage your records (get, update, insert, list and delete) and files (upload).

To learn more about the Zendesk activities, see the Activities page for a complete activity list and links to the activity detail pages.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Zendesk, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Zendesk.

Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.
