### Support for long-running workflows

This connector now supports long-running workflows through the Wait for an Event and
                Resume activity. Its purpose is to suspend a job at runtime and resume the job
            whenever a certain event occurs.

## October 7, 2024

Erratum – Added December 3, 2024: The HTTP Request activity was
            mistakenly announced before it was made available.

# HTTP Request activity

A new HTTP Request activity is now available, allowing you to go beyond the
                predefined activities in a given package and make requests to any endpoint of a
                vendor's API.

HTTP Request reuses the connector pre-configuration and provides transparency
                of headers, authentication, and query parameters. You can reuse any of your
                connections, and provide the endpoint and the JSON payload. Use this
                connector-specific HTTP Request activity to benefit from Integration
                Service's capabilities for connection management.

# New features and improvements

This activity package is now always displayed in Studio, in the Activities panel, in the Available section. To install any activity, drag and drop it into the canvas (in Studio Desktop) or add it to your workflow (in Studio Web).

You don't have to manually update the package. As part of UiPath Automation Cloud™, the activity package gets updated automatically.



On the Zendesk connector side, personal OAuth Apps are supported through the Bring your own 2.0 OAuth App authentication method. The standard authentication screen now includes a Scope field, for user authorization.

This release also brings the introduction of custom fields for the Tickets object, with a known limitation.

This release includes general updates regarding design time look-ups and enumerable options, as well as some changes in property display names and descriptions.

# Trigger activities

We've introduced several trigger activities: Group Created, Ticket Created, Ticket Updated, Organization Created, User Created, User Suspended, Record Created, Record Updated.

# Deprecated activities

Some activities have been deprecated. Delete File is no longer included in the package. You can use Delete Record for the same purpose. We've also deprecated List All Recent Tickets and List All Tickets. You can use List All Records instead.

# Activity updates

Two new activities are available: Search Users and Search Tickets.

We've renamed some activities. Upload File is now Upload Attachment. Replace Group, Replace Ticket, and Replace User are now called Update Group, Update Ticket, and Update User, respectively.

In the List All Ticket Comments activity, we've removed the Include property, as it was redundant.

# Known limitation

Currently the mandatory custom fields don't show up directly on the activity canvas. They need to be accessed from Manage Properties. This issue will be fixed in a later release, and the required fields, either standard or custom, will appear directly on the canvas.

# Bug fixes

* The Search Tickets activity didn't contain any custom fields in the response.
* We also implemented other minor bug fixes for this package.


## V5.0.0

Release Date: December 20, 2022

# New features and improvements

Starting with this version of the package, Windows - Legacy projects are no longer supported. Instead, you can use the activity package for Windows or Cross-platform projects.

This activity pack is only compatible with Studio v22.10 and above.

Also starting with version 5.0.0, the activity package has gone scopeless, which means you no longer have to drag and drop an activity inside the Zendesk Scope activity to configure a connection. You can simply add your activity into the workflow and configure the connection within each activity using the ConnectionId field.

Besides Zendesk Scope, the following activities were also removed from the package:

* Show File
* List Records
* Delete Ticket
* Get Ticket

The following activities were added to the package:

* Create Group
* Replace Group
* Create User
* Replace User
* When an event happens

# Breaking changes

When updating the activity package from version 4.x to version 5.x, your workflows won't work anymore and you have to rebuild them as version 5.x is not backwards compatible with version 4.x due to dropping support for Window - Legacy projects. For more details, please contact our support team.


## V4.0.2

Release Date: June 27,2022

# New features and improvements

Both design time and run time now support the ability to select a connection to use in the Configure Connection Wizard. Before, you could only use the connection that was set as default, even when you would create multiple connections. With this new functionality, you can now select from the drop-down the connection you want to use in Studio (design time) and the connection you want to use on the robot (run time) when executing the process.

The Zendesk activities package has been upgraded to .NET6.

Implemented telemetry changes.
