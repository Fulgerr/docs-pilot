# Improvements

When selecting a Tickets object in Get Record and List All Records, a
                new Include parameter is available. This allows you to embed additional
                details on the response.

Additional fields are available on the Tickets object, such as
                    cc_emails and reply_cc_emails. This allows you
                to retrieve more details from Freshdesk tickets.

### Support for long-running workflows

This connector now supports long-running workflows through the Wait for an Event and
                Resume activity. Its purpose is to suspend a job at runtime and resume the job
            whenever a certain event occurs.

# HTTP Request activity

A new HTTP Request activity is now available, allowing you to go beyond the
                predefined activities in a given package and make requests to any endpoint of a
                vendor's API.

HTTP Request reuses the connector pre-configuration and provides transparency
                of headers, authentication, and query parameters. You can reuse any of your
                connections, and provide the endpoint and the JSON payload. Use this
                connector-specific HTTP Request activity to benefit from Integration
                Service's capabilities for connection management.
