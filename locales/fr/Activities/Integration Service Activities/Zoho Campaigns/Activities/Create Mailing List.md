Check the created public mailing list in the UI to see
                    whether the Signup form field is enabled or disabled. If enabled, only
                    the first subscriber's email is automatically added to the mailing list. The
                    rest of the subscribers must confirm their subscription using the signup form
                    sent to their email address. This limitation does not apply to private mailing
                    lists.
