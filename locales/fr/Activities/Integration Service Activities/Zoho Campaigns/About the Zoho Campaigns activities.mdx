To learn more about the Zoho Campaigns activities, see the  page for a complete list and descriptions.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Zoho Campaigns, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Zoho Campaigns. Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.

Once established, the connection to the Zoho Campaigns instance can be used in all activities of the package.
