# About the Sugar Enterprise activities

Sugar Enterprise is the premier sales force automation product for on-premises deployment. Enterprise provides the power and ease-of-use that Sugar is known for, in an on-premises package supporting higher levels of customizability and control. After connecting, add automation to every business process—manage sales, leads and campaigns, customer support, and performance metrics.

The activities give your UiPath robot(s) the ability to manage your records (get, update, insert, list and delete).

To learn more about the Sugar Enterprise activities, see the Activities page for a complete activity list and links to the activity detail pages.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Sugar Enterprise, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Sugar Enterprise.

Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.
