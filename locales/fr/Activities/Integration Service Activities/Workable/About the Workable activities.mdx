# About the Workable activities

Workable is a cloud-based hiring software for applicant tracking, sourcing, and managing candidates, streamlining recruitment processes.



To learn more about the Workable activities, see the Activities page for a complete list and descriptions.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Workable, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Workable. Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.

Once established, the connection to the Workable instance can be used in all activities of the package.
