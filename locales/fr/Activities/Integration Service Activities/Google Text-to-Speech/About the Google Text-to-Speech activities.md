# About the Google Text-to-Speech activities

Google Text-to-Speech enables the transformation of any strings, words, or sentences into audio mimicking human speech.



To learn more about the Google Text-to-Speech activities, see the  page for a complete list and descriptions.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Google Text-to-Speech, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Text-to-Speech. Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.

Once established, the connection to the Google Text-to-Speech instance can be used in all activities of the package.
