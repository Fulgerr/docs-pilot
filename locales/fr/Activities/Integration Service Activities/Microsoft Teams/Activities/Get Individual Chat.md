User email (UPN) - The
                        user principal name. This should be the unique user login to Azure AD and
                        other Office services. In very rare cases, UPN could be set to something
                        else by an Azure AD admin. This field supports String type
                        input. User role - The role
                        of the user, which can be Owner or Guest. The Owner is a
                        channel admin that can manage the channel and its members while Guest is a
                        person invited from outside the organization.
