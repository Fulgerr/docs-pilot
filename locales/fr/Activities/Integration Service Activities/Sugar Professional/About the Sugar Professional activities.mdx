# About the Sugar Professional activities

Sugar Professional brings customer data into one place and builds on top of that with a complete system for sales automation, collaboration, and reporting. Sugar customers can drive revenue, increase efficiency, reduce sales costs, and deliver unmatched customer value.

The activities give your UiPath robot(s) the ability to manage your records (get, update, insert, list and delete).

To learn more about the Sugar Professional activities, see the Activities page for a complete activity list and links to the activity detail pages.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Sugar Professional, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Sugar Professional.

Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.
