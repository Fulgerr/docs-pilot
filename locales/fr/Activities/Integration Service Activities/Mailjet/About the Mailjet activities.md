# About the Mailjet activities

Mailjet is a cloud-based email delivery and tracking system which allows users to send marketing emails and transactional emails.

To learn more about the Mailjet activities, see the Activities page for a complete activity list and links to the activity details.



# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath® and Mailjet, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Mailjet. Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.

Once established, the connection to the Mailjet instance can be used in all activities of the package.
