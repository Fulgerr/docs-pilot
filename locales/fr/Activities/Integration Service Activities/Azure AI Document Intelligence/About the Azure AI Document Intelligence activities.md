# About the Azure AI Document Intelligence activities

Azure AI Document Intelligence (formerly Form Recognizer) is a cloud-based Azure AI service that uses machine-learning models to automate your data processing in applications and workflows.



To learn more about the Azure AI Document Intelligence activities, see the  page for a complete list and descriptions.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Azure AI Document Intelligence, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Azure AI Document Intelligence. Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.

Once established, the connection to the Azure AI Document Intelligence instance can be used in all activities of the package.
