# About the Eventbrite activities

Eventbrite is an event management tool that makes it simple to create, manage, promote, and sell out your event.

# Eventbrite Activities Package

Once established, the connection to the Eventbrite instance can be reused in all activities in the package.

To learn more about the Eventbrite activities, see the Activities page for a complete activity list and links to the activity details.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Eventbrite, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Eventbrite.

Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.
