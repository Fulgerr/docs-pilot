# About the ZoomInfo activities

ZoomInfo grants users access to contact details and company profiles, enabling them to explore potential customers and generate focused lists.



To learn more about the ZoomInfo activities, see the Activities page for a complete list and descriptions.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and ZoomInfo, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for ZoomInfo. Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.

Once established, the connection to the ZoomInfo instance can be used in all activities of the package.
