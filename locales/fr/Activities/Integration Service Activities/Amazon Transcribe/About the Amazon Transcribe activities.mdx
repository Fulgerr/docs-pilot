# About the Amazon Transcribe activities

Amazon Transcribe is a cloud-based automatic speech recognition (ASR) service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). This service converts speech into text, enabling developers to add speech-to-text capabilities to their applications.



To learn more about the Amazon Transcribe activities, see the Activities page for a complete list and descriptions.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Amazon Transcribe, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Amazon Transcribe. Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.

Once established, the connection to the Amazon Transcribe instance can be used in all activities of the package.
