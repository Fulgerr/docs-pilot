# About the Amazon Bedrock activities

Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that makes foundational models (LLMs) from leading AI startups and Amazon available via an API, so you can choose the best model for your generative AI automation use cases.

To learn more about the Amazon Bedrock activities, see the Activities page for a complete activity list and links to the activity detail pages.



# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Amazon Bedrock, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Amazon Bedrock.

Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.
