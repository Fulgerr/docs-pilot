# About the Facebook activities

Facebook is a popular free social networking website that enables users to share information and photos with followers via groups and pages.



To learn more about the Facebook activities, see the Activities page for a complete activity list and details.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Facebook, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Facebook. Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.
