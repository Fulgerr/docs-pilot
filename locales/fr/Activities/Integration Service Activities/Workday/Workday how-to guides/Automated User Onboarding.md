# Automated User Onboarding

Applications: Workday, Azure Active Directory

Description: Upon the creation of a new worker in Workday, the system
            initiates the onboarding process in Azure Active Directory. This enables the IT team to
            automate the provisioning of user accounts.

1. Open Studio Web and
                create a new project. Make sure that in the New Project window, in the How to
                    start the automation drop-down, Event based is selected.
2. Add an Event Trigger
                activity and in the Event field, select Employee Created . Next,
                configure the activity as follows: Connect to your
                        Workday account.Additional filters
                        may be added to your automation, depending on your needs.
3. Next, add a Workday: Get Record activity to your canvas, configure Select Object to Employees and
                Switch to Object View . For employeeID
                        select the Output of the Event Trigger.
4. Next, add a Azure Active Directory: Create User activity to your project. Set up your Azure
                        AD connection.For the Mail
                            Nickname field, select the output of the Workday Get Record
                        activity and choose Response > Personal_Data > Name_Data >
                            Legal_Name_Data > Name_Detail_Data > First_Name.For the User
                            Principal Name, since you need to concatenate two or more values,
                        open the Expression Editor, and write “merge three strings”. The
                        correct expression is automatically created.Next, replace
                            string1 and string2 with the Get
                            Record outputs Response > Personal_Data > Name_Data >
                            Legal_Name_Data > Name_Detail_Data > First_Name, and
                            Response > Personal_Data > Name_Data > Legal_Name_Data >
                            Name_Detail_Data > Last_Name, respectively.Add
                            your company domain in the string3 position.For the Name
                        property field, you can follow step d. again, concatenating two
                        strings.Replace
                            string1 and string2 with the Get
                            Record outputs Response > Personal_Data > Name_Data >
                            Legal_Name_Data > Name_Detail_Data > First_Name and
                            Response > Personal_Data > Name_Data > Legal_Name_Data >
                            Name_Detail_Data > Last_Name, respectively.Add the Initial
                            Password.You can also
                        optionally fill the Job Info and Identity property fields,
                        according to your needs.

                new employee is automatically onboarded in Azure Active Directory.
