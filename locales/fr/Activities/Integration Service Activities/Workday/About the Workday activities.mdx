# About the Workday activities

Workday offers enterprise-level software solutions for financial management, human resources, and planning. The Uipath.Workday.IntegrationService.Activities package enables you to automate interactions with your Workday application. It connects to Workday via the UiPath Connector for Workday.

# Workday activity package

Once established, the connection to the Workday instance can be reused in all subsequent activities.

If you're using a version of the Workday Activities package that does not support the Integration Service, you can access its documentation here.

# How it Works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Workday, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Workday.

Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.
