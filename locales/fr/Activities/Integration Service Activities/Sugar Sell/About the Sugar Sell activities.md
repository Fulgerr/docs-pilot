# About the Sugar Sell activities

Sugar Sell is a cloud-based sales automation solution suitable for small, medium and large businesses. It offers lead management, opportunity management, account management, contact management, reporting, collaboration, product management, quote management, sales forecasting and business process management (BPM).

The activities give your UiPath robot(s) the ability to manage your records (get, update, insert, list and delete).

To learn more about the Sugar Sell activities, see the Activities page for a complete activity list and links to the activity detail pages.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Sugar Sell, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Sugar Sell.

Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.
