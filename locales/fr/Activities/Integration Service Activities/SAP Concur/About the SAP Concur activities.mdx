# About the SAP Concur activities

The UiPath.SapConcur.IntegrationService.Activities package enables you to automate Concur processes. It connects to Concur via the UiPath Connector for SAP Concur. You can find out more information about our connector from the About SAP Concur page.

# SAP Concur activity package

Once established in Integration Service, the default connection to the SAP Concur instance is used in all the activities in the package.

To learn more about the SAP Concur activities, see the Activities page for a complete list and links to the activity details.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and SAP Concur, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for SAP Concur.

Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.
