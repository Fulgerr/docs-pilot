# About the Egnyte activities

Egnyte is a cloud-based platform for secure file sharing, collaboration, and content governance for businesses and enterprises.



To learn more about the Egnyte activities, see the Activities page for a complete list and descriptions.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Egnyte, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Egnyte. Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.

Once established, the connection to the Egnyte instance can be used in all activities of the package.
