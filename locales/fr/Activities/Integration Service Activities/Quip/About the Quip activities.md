# About the Quip activities

Quip is a collaborative and productivity software that combines documents, spreadsheets, and chat in a unified platform.



To learn more about the Quip activities, see the Activities page for a complete list and descriptions.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Quip, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Quip. Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.

Once established, the connection to the Quip instance can be used in all activities of the package.
