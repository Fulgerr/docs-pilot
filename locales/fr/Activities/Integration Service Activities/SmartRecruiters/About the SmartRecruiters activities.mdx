# About the SmartRecruiters activities

SmartRecruiters provides you a collaborative candidate management tool where you can work in sync with your team members and streamline the process of hiring.

To learn more about the SmartRecruiters activities, see the Activities page for a complete activity list and links to the activity details.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and SmartRecruiters, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for SmartRecruiters.

Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.
