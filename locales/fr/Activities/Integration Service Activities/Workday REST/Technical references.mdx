# Using the Execute WQL Query
                activity

To use the  activity,
                    you must configure the System - Workday Query Language scope. For more
                    information, see Workday authentication. Workday Query Language or WQL is an
                SQL-like query language that provides enhanced capabilities to query Workday data.
                Since it resembles SQL, you can manually create queries within Workday or convert an
                existing report to WQL using the  activity.

You can convert advanced and matrix reports to Workday Query Language (WQL), then use
                the resulting query in the 
                activity to extract data from Workday.

Use the example below for reference:

1. In Workday, search for the Convert Report to WQL task.
2. Select the report you want to convert and select the Converted WQL Query String.
3. Next, input the copied query in the activity and select the Generate output schema button.
4. This action generates a list of output fields.

You can also explore Workday tables using the Data sources object and create
                your own queries. You can access table columns through the Data source fields
                object, and filterable fields are available in the Data source filters
                object. For more information, refer to the Workday REST documentation on dataSources.

Important things to consider

You must first generate the output schema of your query results, and then
                            replace any column values with variables afterwards, at design time.You can use LIMIT and OFFSET parameters
                            to paginate through large sets of data.You may encounter the following error message if: Error message: It seems the provided input is either
                                        incorrectly structured or contains a variable.The System scope is absent from the API client. Check your
                                    API client's Scopes (Functional Area).Your query is incorrect or contains variables. Make sure you
                                    successfully run the View WQL Query Result task in
                                    Workday and use the correct query in the 
                                    activity.
