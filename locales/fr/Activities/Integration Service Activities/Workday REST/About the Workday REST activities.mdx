# About the Workday REST activities

The Workday REST Connector provides seamless integration with Workday's extensive suite of Human Capital Management (HCM) and Financial Management solutions through a modern, lightweight, and efficient RESTful interface.



To learn more about the Workday REST activities, see the  page for a complete list and descriptions.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Workday REST, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Workday REST. Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.

Once established, the connection to the Workday REST instance can be used in all activities of the package.
