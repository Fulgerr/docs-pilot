                cannot populate the required fields programmatically.


## October 7, 2024

Erratum – Added December 3, 2024: The HTTP Request activity was
            mistakenly announced before it was made available.

# HTTP Request activity

A new HTTP Request activity is now available, allowing you to go beyond the
                predefined activities in a given package and make requests to any endpoint of a
                vendor's API.

HTTP Request reuses the connector pre-configuration and provides transparency
                of headers, authentication, and query parameters. You can reuse any of your
                connections, and provide the endpoint and the JSON payload. Use this
                connector-specific HTTP Request activity to benefit from Integration
                Service's capabilities for connection management.

# What's New

This activity pack is now always displayed in the Available section of the
                Activities panel in Studio. Any activity in this package can be installed by simply

                from now on for this package, as updates will be done automatically to the
