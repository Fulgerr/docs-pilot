# About the Azure Maps activities

Azure Maps empowers users to transform an address or region name into geographical coordinates for use in various location-based services such as weather forecasting.

# Azure Maps activity package

Once established, the connection to the Azure Maps instance can be reused in all activities in the package.

To learn more about the Azure Maps activities, see the Activities page for a complete activity list and links to the activity details.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Azure Maps, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Azure Maps.

Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.
