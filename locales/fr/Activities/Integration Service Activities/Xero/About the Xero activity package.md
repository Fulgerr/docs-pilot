# About the Xero activity package

Xero is a cloud-based accounting system. After connecting, you can manage processes from
            accounting and finance to sales and purchasing.

This activity package can be used with UiPath® Studio versions 2023.10 and newer.

To learn more about the Xero activities, see the Activities
            page for a complete list and descriptions.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Xero, the activities establish
                an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Xero. Before you build
                your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector
                documentation.

Once established, the connection to the Xero instance can be used in all activities
                of the package.
