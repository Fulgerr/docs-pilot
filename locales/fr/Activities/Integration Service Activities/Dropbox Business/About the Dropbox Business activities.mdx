# About the Dropbox Business activities

To benefit from the latest version of the Dropbox activities, use your Dropbox for Business credentials to create a connection to the Dropbox connector. After authenticating, use the regular Dropbox activities in your workflows.The UiPath.DropboxBusiness.IntegrationService.Activities package enables you to automate Dropbox Business processes. It connects to the service via the UiPath Connector for Dropbox Business. You can find out more information about our connector from the About Dropbox Business page.

# Dropbox Business Activities Package

Once established, the connection to the Dropbox Business instance can be reused in all subsequent child Scope activities.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Dropbox Business, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Dropbox Business.
