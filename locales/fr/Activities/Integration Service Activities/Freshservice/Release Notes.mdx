# New features and improvements





This release includes general updates regarding design time look-ups and enumerable options, as well as some changes in property display names and descriptions.

This release also brings the introduction of custom fields for the Tickets object, with a known limitation (see section below).

# Trigger activities

We've introduced four trigger activities. Two are preconfigured: Ticket Created and Ticket Updated. The other are generic – Record Created and Record Updated, configurable based on the supported objects: Changes, Requesters, Tickets, and Agents (supported only on Record Created).

# New activities

Three new activities are available:

Get Agent ID by Email

,

Get Requester ID by Email

, and

Upload Attachment to Ticket

.

# Deprecated activities

Several activities were deprecated, as follows:

The Scope activity was deprecated. Now you can simply add your activity to the workflow and configure the connection using the Connection field.List all tickets and Delete ticket are no longer available. Use List All Records and Delete Record with a Tickets object for the same purposes.The Create ticket with an attachment activity was deprecated. Use the new Upload Attachment to Ticket activity instead. Create ticket with assets was also deprecated. Use Create Ticket for the same use case.

# Known limitation

Currently the mandatory custom fields don't show up directly on the activity canvas. They need to be accessed from Manage Properties. This issue will be fixed in a later release, and the required fields, either standard or custom, will appear directly on the canvas.

# Bug fixes

We also implemented minor bug fixes for this package.
