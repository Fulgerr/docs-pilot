# About the Twilio activities

Twilio allows software developers to programmatically make and receive phone calls, send and receive text messages, and perform other communication functions using its web service APIs. Twilio Messaging is used to send and receive SMS, MMS, OTT messages globally.

To learn more about the Twilio activities, see the Activities page for a complete activity list and links to the activity details.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Twilio, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Twilio.

Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.
