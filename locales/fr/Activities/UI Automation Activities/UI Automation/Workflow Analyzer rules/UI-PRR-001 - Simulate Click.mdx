# UI-PRR-001 - Simulate Click

Rule ID:UI-PRR-001

Scope: Activity

Default action: Warning

This rule applies only to activities that are part of the Classic UI Automation
            experience.

# Description

This rule provides a list of all activities that use either the SimulateClick or the
                    SendWindowMessages properties. These two input methods are mutually
                exclusive, so if an activity is found that has both selected, or none, a warning is
                displayed. The rule considers the SimulateClick and SendWindowMessages
                project settings (Project Settings > UI Automation Classic > Mouse
                    Events) as well.

Using SimulateClick does not rely on the mouse driver, so it provides a faster
                way of performing click actions. On the other hand, some applications might not
                support this click type, so the SendWindowMessages input method is
                recommended. For more details about input methods, refer to the UI Automation page.
