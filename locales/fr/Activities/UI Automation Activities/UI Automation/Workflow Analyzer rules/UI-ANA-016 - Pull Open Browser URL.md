# Description

Retrieves the URLs for the Open Browser activity and
                lists them so they are easy to see. URLs can be volatile and change in time, so this
                listing of URLs in your Open Browser activities helps you keep track of hardcoded
                URLS. For more details about the Open Browser activity, refer to the
