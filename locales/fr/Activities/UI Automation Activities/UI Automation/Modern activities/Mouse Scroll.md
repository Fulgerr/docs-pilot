* Direction - The direction in which you want the scroll to be performed. The following options are available: Left, Up, Right, Down. The default option is Down.
* Scroll type - Select between the two methods of use for this activity:To element - Scrolls until a specified UI element is found in the target application. This is the default option.If you select To Element in the Scroll Type field, the # of scrolls property field is ignored, and the specified UI element is looked for.If, at runtime, the indicated element is not found, the activity scrolls for as much as specified in the # of scrolls field and then retries the search for the indicated element. This behavior is repeated as many times as necessary, until the element is found, and can be useful in the case of applications that have longer loading times.Distance - Only scrolls as much as specified in the # of scrolls property field.The number of lines scrolled by a scroll movement is configured in the Mouse settings section in Windows. If scrolling to a specific element, the element is searched after all rotations are executed. Selecting this method also displays the # of scrolls property in the body of the activity.
