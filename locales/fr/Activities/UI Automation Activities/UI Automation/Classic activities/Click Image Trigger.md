# Click Image Trigger

UiPath.Core.Activities.ClickImageTriggerV2

# Description

Monitors the Image defined by the target UI element for mouse input.

It can be used either inside a Trigger Scope activity or by itself within
                a trigger workflow. When used by itself, the activity has one more property in the
                Properties panel, namely Enabled.

# Properties

Common

* DisplayName - The display name of the activity.

Input

* ClippingRegion - Defines the clipping rectangle, in pixels, relative to the UiElement, in the following directions: left, top, right, bottom. It supports both positive and negative numbers.
* Image.Image - An existing image to be searched for.
* Image.Accuracy - A unit of measurement from 0 to 1 which expresses the minimum similarity between the image you are searching for and the one to be found. Useful in situations when the image to be found is slightly different than the one you are searching for. The default value is 0.8.
* Image.Profile - Enables you to change the image detection algorithm that you want to use. Basic is the classical algorithm, which has average speed and resource cost. Enhanced can offer more precise results, at the expense of more resources. By default, this field is set to Basic.
* MouseButton - The mouse button (left, right, middle) used for the click action. By default, the left mouse button is selected.
* Selector - Text property used to find a particular UI element when the activity is executed. It is actually a XML fragment specifying attributes of the GUI element you are looking for and of some of its parents.

MiscEnabled - If set to False, the trigger starts but does not
                        fire any events. It can be enabled later at runtime by using the Enable
                            Local Trigger activity. This field supports only Boolean
                        values. The default value is True.

* Private - If selected, the values of variables and arguments are no longer logged at Verbose level.

Options

* BlockEvent - Specifies whether the event is blocked from acting on the indicated element. If False, the event is executed against the element. If True, the event is blocked and can be later replayed within the activity handler, by using the ReplayUserEvent activity.
* KeyModifiers - Adds a selected key modifier to the activity. The following options are available: Alt, Ctrl, Shift, Win.
* TriggerMode - Specifies if the event is triggered on Down or Up.
