# Monitor Events

UiPath.Core.Activities.MonitorEvents

This activity has been deprecated. Use the Trigger Scope activity instead.

Listens to multiple activities (also known as triggers) and, when triggered, executes the activities specified in the Event Handler container.

To add a specific type of trigger, search for the keyword "trigger" in the activities panel and drag one of them (ex: click trigger) over the Drop trigger activity here section.

Once the trigger is activated, the Event Handle sequence is executed. You can then use the Get Event Info activity to get the details about the event that triggered.

# Properties

Options

* RepeatForever - This field supports only boolean values (True, False). True - the block executes every time the trigger is activated; this is the default value. False - the activity executes only one time.

Common

* DisplayName - The display name of the activity.
* ContinueOnError - Specifies if the automation should continue even when the activity throws an error. This field only supports Boolean values (True, False). The default value is False. As a result, if the field is blank and an error is thrown, the execution of the project stops. If the value is set to True, the execution of the project continues regardless of any error.If this activity is included in Try Catch and the value of the ContinueOnError property is True, no error is caught when the project is executed.

Misc

* Private - If selected, the values of variables and arguments are no longer logged at Verbose level.
