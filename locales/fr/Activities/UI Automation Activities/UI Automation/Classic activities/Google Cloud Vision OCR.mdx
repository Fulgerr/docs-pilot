# Properties

Common

* DisplayName - The display name of the activity.

Input

* Image - The image that you want to process. This field supports only Image variables.

Logon

* ApiKey - The API key used to provide you access to the Google Cloud OCR.

Misc

* Private - If selected, the values of variables and arguments are no longer logged at Verbose level.

Options

* DetectionMode - Indicates what detection flag to send to the Google Cloud Vision OCR. Select one of two options: TextDetection, DocumentTextDetection. The default value is TextDetection.The TextDetection mode does not report Confidence values for the identified words. When the OCR engine is used within the Digitize Document activity, all OCR Confidence values, for all words, will be set to -1 (Unknown).
* ExtractWords - If this check box is selected, the on-screen position of each detected word is extracted.
* Language - The language used by the OCR engine to extract the text from the UI element or image. For the Google OCR engine, this field needs to contain the language file prefix, such as “rom” for Romanian, “ita” for Italian, and “fra” for French. You can find the supported language prefixes on this page.
* ResizeToMaxLimitIfNecessary - When selected, the engine attempts downsizing the target image so that it does not exceed the size limit of the Google Cloud Vision engine. By default, this check box is cleared.
* Scale - The scaling factor of the selected UI element or image. The higher the number is, the more you enlarge the image. This can provide a better OCR read and it is recommended with small images. If you want to scale down, values between 0 and 1 are also accepted. By default, the value is 2.Large-size images may result in an error when the scaling factor is higher than 1.

Output

* Text - The extracted text. This field supports only string variables.
* Result - The extracted words along with their on-screen position. This field supports only KeyValuePair<rectangle,string> variables.
