# Replay User Event

UiPath.Core.Activities.ReplayUserEventV2

# Description

Replays the user event that was triggered.

If an event was blocked by using the Block event property with one of the
                following activities: Click Event Trigger, Keypress Event
                    Trigger, Hotkey Trigger, Mouse
                    Trigger, Click Image Trigger, System
                    Trigger, that user event can be replayed with the Replay User Event
                activity.

It can be used either within a triggered workflow or within a Trigger Scope activity:

When used within a triggered workflow, the EventInfo
                            object provided for the EventInfo property comes from the
                                TriggerEventArgs input argument of the workflow:
                                TriggerEventArgs.Event.The UI Element that triggered that .xaml can be obtained
                            from the TriggerEventArgs input argument, that has a
                                TargetElement property.

* When used within a Trigger Scope activity, the EventInfo object provided for the EventInfo property comes from the TriggerScope argument: e.g. args.EventInfo.The EventInfo object can later be used by the Get Source Element activity to extract the trigger source element (e.g. UiElement).
