# Open Browser

UiPath.Core.Activities.OpenBrowser

A container that enables you to open a browser at a specified URL and execute multiple
            activities within it.

Internal URLs cannot be opened using this activity when the browser does not
                    directly accept them as command-line arguments.You cannot open Chrome (chrome://) or Edge
                        (edge://) internal pages. You can open, however, Firefox
                        (about:) internal pages.

# In the body of the
                activity

In the designer panel, the activity is presented as a container,
                in which you can add activities to interact with the specified browser.

The
                URL field allows you to provide the link to which the browser opens.

Clicking
                the  button next to the URL field opens a new
                browser session with the current configuration settings. This makes it possible to
                use a new browser user data set while keeping the existing configuration. It can be
                especially useful when you automate browsers in Picture-in-Picture.

A
                sequence is also present, which is where the actions performed on the browser are
                added.

# Properties

Common

* ContinueOnError - Specifies if the automation should continue even when the activity throws an error. This field only supports Boolean values (True, False). The default value is False. As a result, if the field is blank and an error is thrown, the execution of the project stops. If the value is set to True, the execution of the project continues regardless of any error.If this activity is included in Try Catch and the value of the ContinueOnError property is True, no error is caught when the project is executed.
* DisplayName - The display name of the activity.

Input

* BrowserType - Choose the type of browser you want to use by using the dropdown button. The following options are available: IE, Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Custom. The Custom type is suitable for other Chromium-based browsers, such as JxBrowser. The Hidden property is not supported when using the Custom browser type. For more information on configuring the custom browser, view the Custom Browser section.If the BrowserType property is set to Custom, the CommunicationMethod property must be set to WebDriver for the activity to work properly.
* Url - The URL that you want to open in the specified browser.

UserDataFolderMode.DefaultFolder - Uses the default browser folder, no matter if it runs in the main or PIP session. UserDataFolderMode.CustomFolder - Uses the folder specified in UserDataFolderPath or an auto generated path if UserDataFolderPath is not set.

# Custom Browser

A
                    Custom browser is a browser that is different from the widely used
                browsers (Chrome, Chromium Edge, Firefox, IE etc.) and that is built on top of
                Chromium project. We support two categories of such browsers: browsers built with
                Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF) and browsers that use the JxBrowser
                framework.

These custom browsers can be automated by using the
                    WebDriver communication method.

For this to happen, they must
                support the --remote-debugging-port command line parameter, the
                same way all Chromium-based browsers support it.

Configuring
                a Custom Browser

The custom browser you want to use must have a
                    chromedriver.exe executable suitable for the Chromium version
                on top of which the Custom browser was built in PATH.

In the
                registry key HKEY_CURRENT_USER or
                    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, under Software\UiPath\UiPath
                    Platform\CustomBrowser the Command value must hold the path to
                the custom browser executable, or a command that starts that custom
                browser.

Optionally, in cases when you need to run only a single instance of
                the custom browser and, for security reasons, want to specify the
                remote-debugging-port on which communication with the custom browser is done, a
                registry value called RemoteDebuggingPort must be added in the same
                registry key where Command was specified.

Selectors from pages of such
                a custom browser have the browser app name
            custom_browser.

# Example of using the Open Browser
                activity

Here you can see how
                the Open Browser activity is used in an example that incorporates multiple
                activities.
