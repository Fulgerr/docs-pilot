# UI Automation Modern Project Settings

These project settings apply for Modern activities in Windows - Legacy, and Windows
            projects.

Use Project Settings to configure changes at the project level. These global settings impact all activities in the package that have the properties listed below. For more information, see Configuring Activity Project Settings.

The properties configured in Project Settings only take effect in the activities of the workflow if their properties have not been edited. Editing properties manually no longer applies the project settings to them.

To configure the UI Automation Modern project settings, follow these steps:

1. In the Project panel, go to Project Settings .
2. Navigate to Activities Settings > UI Automation Modern .
3. Modify the settings according to what you want to change.
4. Click OK to save changes.

You can reset all settings to their default values or copy all values between the debug and production fields using the Bulk Actions drop-down menu at the top of the window.

# Generic

The settings below apply to UI Automation Modern activities in Windows - Legacy, and Windows
                projects that have either one of the following properties.

Property nameDescriptionDelay after (seconds)Delay time between the current activity and the next activity.Delay before (seconds)Delay time between the previous activity and the current activity.Timeout (seconds)How long to wait for the current activity to be executed before throwing an error.Wait for page loadBefore performing the action, wait for the application to become ready to accept input. The following options are available:None - Does not wait for the target to be ready.Interactive - Waits until only a part of the application is loaded.Complete - Waits for the entire application to load.Capture screenshotsDictates if screenshots are captured at design time by all the activities that support this feature. If the setting is set to false, the Remove informative screenshot option from the context menu is disabled.Show closest matches in the 'Element not found' error messageIf set to True, ten suggestions of the closest selector matches that can be used to replace the faulty selectors are displayed in the logs.Alter disabled elementIf set to True, the Select Item action is executed even if the specified UI element is disabled. This property does not apply if the Input Mode property is set to Hardware Events.Wait for primary targeting method until timeoutIf set to True, this setting allows the primary targeting method to consume its full timeout until any fallback targeting method can be used.Ask user on runtime errorIf set to True, a prompt is displayed allowing you to
                                decide what to do next and continue the automation instead of just
                                stopping the execution.Automatically add UI elements to Object RepositoryIf set to True, all UI elements are automatically added to
                                Object Repository.

# Targeting methods - Desktop applications

The settings below apply to indicated targets and anchors for desktop applications.

Property nameDescriptionInput modeSelect how to execute the action:Hardware Events - Simulates the click by using the hardware driver. This is the slowest method, it cannot work in the background, but it is compatible with all desktop applications. Simulate - Simulates the click using accessibility APIs. Recommended in browser automation, Java apps, or SAP. More reliable than Hardware Events. Works even if the target application is not in focus. Test if your target application UI element supports this.Window Messages - Simulates using Win32 messages. Recommended for desktop apps. Usually more reliable than Hardware Events. Sends all text in one go. Works even if the target application is not in focus. Before using this method, test if your target application UI element supports this.Background - Runs actions in the background. Tries to use Simulate where possible, while complex activities (image, native text) run as usual, in the foreground.Note: Using the Background input mode with Universal Windows Platform applications is not supported, which means apps of this type cannot be automated in the background.Strict selectorIf set to True, uses the Strict selector method.Fuzzy selectorIf set to True, uses the Fuzzy selector method.Computer VisionIf set to True, uses the Computer Vision method. The default value is True.ImageIf set to True, uses the Image
                                    targeting method.Note: This method is only used
                                    for the Check App State activity if the other methods are
                                    disabled.Ignore selectors with IDX / tableRow / tableColDisable the full selector if the target selector has a tableRow, tableCol, or an idx attribute with a value higher than 1 and anchors exist.Generate native WPF selectors (Preview)Enable the generation of native WPF selectors for WPF applications.
