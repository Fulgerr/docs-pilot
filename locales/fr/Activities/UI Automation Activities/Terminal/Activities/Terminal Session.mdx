This field supports only TerminalSession variables.

### The Configure Connection window

The Configure Connection window contains various configuration options that vary
            depending on the type of provider chosen for making the connection to the terminal
            environment.

Properties independent of the chosen provider:

* Show client application - If
                checked, displays a view of the terminal screen at runtime.
