# Move Cursor

UiPath.Terminal.Advanced.Activities.TerminalMoveCursor

# Description

Moves the cursor position to a specified location.

The activity is valid only inside a Terminal Session activity.

This activity may fail
                if the VT family of terminals is being used, either with the Direct Connection
                provider or with a provider using a 3rd party terminal emulator, like IBM EHLLAPI.
                This happens because the VT family of terminals manages the cursor position on the
                application side, not on the front-end. In order to avoid this, use alternative ways
                of moving the cursor location, like Send Control Key with
                    Tab.
