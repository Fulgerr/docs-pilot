# Set Field at Position

UiPath.Terminal.Advanced.Activities.TerminalSetFieldAtPosition

# Description

Writes a specified String into a form field identified by given coordinates.

The activity is valid only inside a Terminal Session activity.

This activity fails if the VT family of terminals is being used, either with the Direct Connection provider or with a provider using a 3rd party terminal emulator, like IBM EHLLAPI. This happens because the VT family of terminals does not support fields.

Options

* Backwards Compatible—Changes the behavior of the activity as follows:True—(slower) Preserves the same behavior as for activity package versions 2.8.1 and earlier. The activity scans the screen for fields and sets the value of the target field without changing the cursor position.False—(faster) Performs Move Cursor to the desired coordinates, followed by a Send Keys. Unlike 2.8.1 and earlier versions, the cursor is moved. This is the default behavior whenever a new activity is added to the workflow.Not set (null)—Default selection for existing workflows. Has the same behavior as True.
* DelayMS—Delay time (in milliseconds) after executing the activity. The default amount of time is 300 milliseconds (0.3 seconds).
* TimeoutMS—Specifies the amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait for the activity to run before an error is thrown. The default value is 5000 milliseconds (5 seconds).
* WaitType—Before performing the actions, wait for the target to become ready. The following options are available:NONE—Does not wait for the terminal keyboard to be enabled.READY / COMPLETE—Waits for the terminal keyboard to be enabled. The default value is READY.The READY and COMPLETE options have the same function, since the wait type is related to the status of the terminal keyboard, which has only two states: enabled or inhibited.

Position

* Column—The column position where the cursor is moved. Only values greater than 0 are supported.
* Row—The row position where the cursor is moved. Only values greater than 0 are supported.
