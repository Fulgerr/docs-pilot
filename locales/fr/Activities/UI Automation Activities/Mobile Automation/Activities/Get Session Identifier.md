# Get Session Identifier

UiPath.MobileAutomation.Activities.GetSessionIdentifier

# Description

Retrieve the session ID of the current Mobile Device Manager connection to route HTTP commands to
                Appium endpoints so you can perform custom actions.

# Use case example

You can use the WebAPI activity package to make HTTP
                requests by using the Get Session Identifier to build endpoint request.

In the following example, the HTTP request activity was used to retrieve
                the system time from an Appium endpoint. The endpointPath variable
                was used to concatenate the Appium session ID (e.g., "https://yourAppiumURL"
                    + "/session/" + sessionId + "/appium/device/system_time").

Common

* ContinueOnError - Specifies if the automation should continue even when the activity throws an error. This field only supports Boolean values (True, False). The default value is False. As a result, if the field is blank and an error is thrown, the execution of the project stops. If the value is set to True, the execution of the project continues regardless of any error.
* DisplayName - The display name of the activity.

Misc
