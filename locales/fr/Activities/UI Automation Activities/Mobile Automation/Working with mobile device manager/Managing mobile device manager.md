# Managing mobile device manager

Manage your devices and applications through Mobile Device Manager (MDM).

# Mobile Device Manager Conditions

* Access to MDM is done only through Studio
* You can only start a single MDM instance at a time.

# Quick Actions

Mobile Device Manager fires up showing you a Welcome tab where you can quickly take several actions, such as starting an application or opening a log.

![welcome_tab_MDM=GUID-917DB83B-3CF9-4F75-902E-3BEDC92C7739=1=en=Default](/images/welcome_tab_MDM=GUID-917DB83B-3CF9-4F75-902E-3BEDC92C7739=1=en=Default.png)

The following table lists the actions that you can take in the Welcome tab.

For more information, see Managing Applications.Start an applicationCreate a connection by selecting a device and an application, and switching logging settings.For more ways of starting an application, see Starting an Application.Open logChoose and open a log in a new tab to review actions, requests, and events. For more information, see Logs and Execution Timeline.Export ConfigurationsExport the list of configured devices and applications as a JSON file.Import ConfigurationsImport the list of configured devices and applications as a JSON file. New configurations are added on top of existing ones, if applicable. Duplicate devices and applications are deleted if found during importing.

# Managing Project Settings

The project settings apply to the current project only. You can change the default log path, configure device interaction settings, or variables your devices and applications.

# Configuring Project Level Settings

To configure project settings, open Mobile Device Manager, and navigate to Project Setting > Project Level Settings. The following table lists the settings that you can configure at the project level.

SettingsDescriptionLogs pathChange the default log path. Consider setting the log path to a shared network drive to expand member access to resources. For more information, see Logs and Execution Timeline.Context-aware elements discoveryImprove element discoverability when you hover your mouse over the device, based on context-awareness. This feature is activated by default. For more information, see Device Interaction.Maximum allowed lengths for IDsSet a practical length for your element ID. The default value is set to 40.Normalize slider valueSet a range for your slider value between 0 and 1.

# Configuring Variables

Define variables to build dynamic values. For example, if you have an Appium endpoint, you can define a variable to be used for all of your devices. You can use variables when you configure both devices and applications.

To configure variables:

1. Open Studio and navigate to Mobile Automation > Mobile Device Manager.
2. Navigate to Project Settings > Variables.
3. Configure a Name and a Value. You can only add letter characters.
4. Click Save & Close.

# Working with variables

When you configure devices, you can use variables for the following fields:

* Name
* Device Name
* Platform Version.

For application configuration, you can use variables for the following fields:

* App
* App Package
* App Activity
* Start Page.

# Configuring custom Http Headers

Add custom http headers to the default one that Appium generates to allow for an
                easier mobile testing experience behind a proxy. Custom Http headers allow mobile
                testing to work with proxies that accept only certain headers, by specifically
                adding them. The custom headers that you add don't overwrite the already existent
                header, but they add to the collection of values that the header can support.

# Working with Http Headers

Open Studio and navigate to Mobile Automation > Mobile Device
                            Manager.Navigate to Project Settings > Http Headers.Configure a Key (name of the custom header) and a Value
                            (the actual value of the custom header).You can't add variables
                            inside the Value field.Click Save & Close.Select the connection details
                        inside the Mobile Device Connection activity or the Connect
                            coded automation API.The custom Http Headers that you added inside MDM are imported in
                            the activity, inside the Http Headers collection.Add more custom Http headers inside the Http Headers collection from
                        the activity.These headers won't appear inside MDM, but they will apply
                            for the mobile device connection that you created before adding
                                them.If you change the details of the mobile device connection
                                    you:Lose the Http
                                        headers created directly in the Mobile Device
                                            Connection activity or the Connect coded automation API,
                                        inside the Http Headers collection.Maintain the
                                        Http headers created directly in MDM.

# Using Output messages

If you want to debug certain errors or warnings, you can take the messages that
                appear in the Output panel of Mobile Device Manager and copy them for further
                troubleshooting. Additionally, you can check the  for that
                automation.
