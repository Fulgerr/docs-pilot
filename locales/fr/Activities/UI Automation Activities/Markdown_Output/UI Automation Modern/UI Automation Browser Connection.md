# UI Automation Browser Connection

# Description

The UI Automation Browser Connection capability helps the robot authenticate instead of
                the user, when the automation runs unattended, in the cloud, serverless.

This feature specifically addresses
                n-factor authentication automation scenarios. The most popular web enterprise
                business applications use n-factor authentication. Such an authentication mechanism
                requires the user to insert a security code, solve a captcha, or use a security
                token to complete the authentication, before accessing the application’s functional
                modules.

During a cloud automation execution, the user’s intervention to authenticate isn't possible and,
                even more, not recommended. Using the UI Automation Browser Connection
                capability, the robot resolves by itself the authentication process, based on the
                information provided when the automation was created, and it runs according to its
                schedule without requiring any user input.

# Adding a connection

To add a connection, follow the steps
                below:

1. Click the Add activity button and add a Use Browser activity within your workflow.
2. Select the drop-down menu from the Work in scope field and choose the tab you want to automate.
3. Switch on the Requires Authentication toggle.
4. Under the Connection field, select the plus button and then choose Add connection.
5. Under Connection name, enter a unique name for your connection.
6. (Optional) Under Connection description, write a description for your connection.
7. The URL for sign in is automatically filled in based on your selection. Click Submit.
8. You are now taken to the UI Automation Browser Connection screen where you need to sign in using your credentials.
9. After successfully signing in, click the I'm done button. You are now taken back to your project where the new connection has been added.

This is how the entire process should look like:

# Editing a connection

To edit a connection, follow the steps
                below:

1. Under the Connection field, select the plus button and then choose Edit connection.
2. You are now taken to the UI Automation Browser Connection screen where you can reauthenticate if needed.

# Configuring the browser

Besides using the UI Automation Browser Connection feature to authenticate, you can
                also use it to configure your browser.

Since the execution machine is always a new one, the browser is always in a fresh
                state and you might see certain popups at execution time causing your automation to
                fail.

So,you can use the feature to put the browser in the right state when building the
                workflow. Then, the robot makes sure the same state is set when starting the
                automation.

# Limitations

Azure Active Directory authentication

While using Azure Active Directory accounts for authentication, paired with the UI
                Automation Browser Connection feature, the automation runs repeatedly in a cloud
                environment. This might lead to the Active Directory server triggering identity
                protection mechanisms like asking the user to solve a captcha, or to change the
                account password.

To avoid this, we strongly suggest
                using dedicated service accounts specially configured for the robots.

Orchestrator shared folders

UI Automation Browser Connection cannot be used with Orchestrator shared folders,
                only with Orchestrator personal workspaces.

Application restrictions

The feature doesn’t work for web applications that delete the authentication cookies when the
                user closes the browser, thus mimicking a log out. For example, www.salesforce.com.

Studio Desktop

You cannot create or edit connections in Studio Desktop.

Server-based robots

At runtime, this feature is only supported for serverless robots, otherwise it throws
                an exception. If you have a Windows robot, for instance, you get a platform
                    not supported runtime exception.
