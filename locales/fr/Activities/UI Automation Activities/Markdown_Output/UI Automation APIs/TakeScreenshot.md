# TakeScreenshot(TargetAnchorableModel, String)

Takes a screenshot of a specified UI element or application and saves it to a file,
                identified by the TargetAnchorableModel object, while specifying
                the file name.

TakeScreenhot(
    TargetAnchorableModel target, 
    string fileName)

targetTargetAnchorableModelThe target to take a screenshot from, identified by the
                            TargetAnchorableModel object. Leave
                            null to take a screenshot of the entire desktop.fileNameStringThe name of the file you want to save.

# Code example

Here is a brief walkthrough of a sample code implementation.

This line of code sets up the file path where the screenshot is saved.

var filePath = "C:\\samplefile.jpg";

This command attaches to a screen from an already opened application.

var sampleApp = uiAutomation.Attach(Descriptors.NewApplication.NewScreen);

The TakeScreenshot API gets invoked here, capturing the screenshot
                of the newly specified element on your screen and subsequently saving it to the
                defined file path.

sampleApp.TakeScreenshot(Descriptors.NewApplication.NewScreen.NewElement, filePath);

Checks whether the screenshot file exists at the given filePath.

var fileExists = system.FileExists(filePath);

Finally, the statement verifies that the screenshot file has been saved successfully
                to the target filePath.

testing.VerifyAreEqual(fileExists, true);

# Adding options

You can add options in your code in two ways.

One way to add options is to use the right overload. To do this, press
                    Ctrl + Space, and IntelliSense appears,
                enabling you to browse and select your preferred overload. You might decide to
                select the overload where you have the parameters set up in advance. Optional
                parameters are indicated within by brackets.

If you want to initialize a single setting like windowResize, you
                can use this syntax:

var sampleApp = uiAutomation.Attach(Descriptors.NewApplication.NewScreen, windowResize: NWindowResize.Restore);

Another way to add options is to use a common option overload, such as Attach, and
                pair it with the Options class. This offers a bit more flexibility
                in customizing your parameters.
