# Use Foreground

UiPath.Core.Activities.UseForegroundScope

Moves the current background process into the foreground, executing all the activities it
            contains. After the execution is complete, the process is moved back into the
            background.

# Properties

Common

* ContinueOnError - Specifies if the automation should continue even when the activity throws an error. This field only supports Boolean values (True, False). The default value is False. As a result, if the field is blank and an error is thrown, the execution of the project stops. If the value is set to True, the execution of the project continues regardless of any error.If this activity is included in Try Catch and the value of the ContinueOnError property is True, no error is caught when the project is executed.
* DisplayName - The display name of the activity.
* Wait for foreground - The maximum amount of time the process should wait in order to move into the foreground. If left empty, it will wait for an infinite amount of time. If the process does not move into the foreground in the specified amount of time, an InvalidOperationException error is thrown. By default, this field is empty.

Misc

* Private - If selected, the values of variables and arguments are no longer logged at Verbose level.

# In UiPath Assistant

When a
                process is running in the background it displays the background icon in UiPath
                    Assistant. When it acquires the foreground, the background icon
                disappears.

# Queue Mechanism

If you
                start a background process with a foreground scope and another entity is running in
                the foreground (either a process or another foreground scope), the background
                process goes into a queue and waits (determined by the Wait for foreground
                property) to acquire foreground.

There is no limit to the items in this
                queue.

Only background processes with a foreground scope make use of this
                queue, not standalone foreground processes. This means that a foreground process
                fails if started while you are running either another foreground process or a
                background process with a foreground scope.

Background processes that are
                waiting in the queue to acquire foreground display an hourglass icon.
