# UI-PRR-004 - Hardcoded Delays

Rule ID:UI-PRR-004

Scope: Activity

Default action: Warning

This rule applies to activities that are part of both the Classic and the Modern UI
            Automation experiences.

# Description

Displays a list of all the activities that contain hardcoded delay values in properties such as DelayMS, DelayBefore, DelayAfter, and DelayBetweenKeys. To wait for application states, we recommend using other mechanisms, such as Timeout, because delays may affect the overall robot process response performance. We recommend adding annotations that explain the usage of the Delay when it is absolutely necessary to use it. For more details about synchronization, refer to the UI Automation page.
