                                    string, bool, bool)Verifies the truth of a given expression, considering several
                                configurations, such as a certain output message format, or an
                                alternative verification title.

                                    outputMessageFormat section.continueOnFailureBooleanSpecifies if the automation should continue even when the activity throws an
                        error. The default value is False. As a result, if the field is blank and an
                        error is thrown, the execution of the project stops. If the value is set to
                        True, the execution of the project continues regardless of any error.alternativeVerificationTitleStringThis title will be displayed in orchestrator.takeScreenshotInCaseOfFailingAssertionBooleanIf set to True, takes a screenshot of the target process if
                        the verification has failed.takeScreenshotInCaseOfSucceedingAssertionBooleanIf set to True, takes a screenshot of the target process if
                        the verification has been successful.

# Return value

Boolean

It is “True” if the Verification passed/succeeded, and “False” if the Verification
                failed.

# Configuring the
                outputMessageFormat

The outputMessageFormat parameter can be configured with supported
                arguments, that act as placeholders for the values used in the verification
                operation. These placeholders are automatically populated with the variables or
                values defined when invoking the coded automation API at runtime.

For the VerifyExpression coded automation API, you can implement the following
                supported arguments when creating an output message:

* {LeftExpression}: Represents the value of the expression you provided for the expression parameter.
* {Result}: Represents the coded automation API's return value, which is the verification result.

The following is an example on how to use the VerifyExpression coded automation API,
                which includes configuring the outputMessageFormat parameter:

// Initialize variables for the expressions to be verified
var expression1 = "User created succesfully";
var expression2 = "successfully created user";

// Employ the VerifyExpression coded automation API, with the last string parameter being the outputMessageFormat
testing.VerifyExpression(expression1 == 23, "{LeftExpression} is {Result}");

In the provided example, the placeholders within the curly brackets are replaced with
                the corresponding variable names and their values at runtime, providing a customized
                output message.
