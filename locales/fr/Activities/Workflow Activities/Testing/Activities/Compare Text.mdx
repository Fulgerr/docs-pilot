# Compare Text

UiPath.Testing.Activities.CompareText

# Description

Verifies if two texts are equivalent, using multiple comparison options, including
                the following comparison types:Comparing words.Comparing lines.Comparing characters as
                            char variables.

The Compare Text activity also allows you to exclude specific sections from
                the comparison process, using predefined rules of type regular expression (regex)
                and wildcard.

* Baseline Text - The base text that is used as a reference for comparison.
* Target Text - The text that is compared against the base document.
* Output File Path - The folder path where the output file will be saved.
* Interpret differences with Autopilot: Perform the verification using the AI capabilities offered by AutpilotTM to obtain a semantic interpretation of the differences.Enabling the Interpret differences with Autopilot option generates an additional output named Semantic Differences, and removes the Comparison Type property.Enabling the Interpret differences with Autopilot option consumes one of the following, depending on the licensing plan your enrolled in:For the Flex licensing plan, the Interpret differences with Autopilot option consumes one AI unit for each activity executionFor the Unified Pricing plan, the Interpret differences with Autopilot option consumes one Platform unit for each activity execution.

Input

* Comparison Type - The type of comparison to use when comparing text. This property is available only if the Interpret differences with Autopilot option is disabled.The following options are available:Line - Compares the texts line by line.Word - Compares the texts word by word.Character - Compares the texts character by character.
* Rules - The list of rules that you want to use to exclude certain sections from comparison. Input the comparison rule output variables you created using the activity.Select Open Collection Builder and add the rules as entries.
* ContinueOnFailure - Specifies if the automation should continue even when the activity throws an error. This field only supports Boolean values (True, False). The default value is False. As a result, if the field is blank and an error is thrown, the execution stops. If the value is set to True, the execution of the project continues regardless of any error.

Output

* Differences - Represents a list of differences resulted from the comparison process. Each Difference comprises an Operation, which signals the type of modification (possible values are Equal, Inserted, or Deleted) and a Text element that highlights the specific content correlated with the operation.
* Result - Defines the final result. It displays True if the verification succeeds and the texts are equivalent. It displays False if the verification does not succeed, indicating differences between the texts.
* Semantic Differences - This property is only available if you enabled the Interpret differences with Autopilot option. Semantic differences represent the results of the text verification process achieved using the AI capabilities of AutopilotTM.
