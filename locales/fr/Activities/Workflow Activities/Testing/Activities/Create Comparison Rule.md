# Create Comparison Rule

# Description

Create Comparison Rule allows you to create comparison rules designed to match
                and exclude specific parts of the text during document or text comparison. The rule
                can use various matching techniques, such as regular expressions (regex) or
                wildcards. These rules allow pattern identification, such as dates, IDs, or dynamic
                content, that should be ignored.

# Configuration

Designer panel

* Rule Name - Represents the rule identifier. This identifier is also used as the placeholder value when excluding specific portions of a text or document.
* Comparison Rule Type - Indicates the specific rule type for identifying and omitting specified segments from the text or documents during comparison. Available rule types include:RegexRule - Allows you to create a regular expression rule.WildcardRule - Allows you to create a wildcard rule.
* Pattern - Specifies the particular sequence or structure used in creating the comparison rule. This pattern should correspond to the text or the section of a document you wish to omit. Depending on the Comparison Rule Type, you can input either a regex or wildcard pattern.

Properties panel

Input

* Use Placeholder - Decide whether to replace the text, which gets excluded by the rule you created, with a placeholder holding the rule's name.
* ContinueOnError - Specifies if the automation should continue even when the activity throws an error. This field only supports Boolean values (True, False). The default value is False. As a result, if the field is blank and an error is thrown, the execution stops. If the value is set to True, the execution of the project continues regardless of any error.

Output

Comparison Rule - The result of the comparison rule.

# Example

This example consists of creating a comparison rule of type regex that excludes any
                date formats from the texts or documents that you are comparing. In this scenario,
                we'll configure the activity as follows:

1. In the Rule Name field, enter a name for the rule.In this example, we are using ExcludeDate as the name.If you choose to display a placeholder value instead of the excluded text (using the Use Placeholder property), then ensure that the rule name is representative for the text you are excluding.
2. From the Comparison Rule Type dropdown list, select RegexRule.
3. In the Pattern field, enter the regular expression sequence that represents all date formats.In this example, use the following regex for representing date formats: @"\b(\d{2}[-\/]\d{2}[-\/]\d{4}|\d{4}[-\/]\d{2}[-\/]\d{2})\b".If you'd like to use a wildcard, you can use the following pattern ??-??-????, where ? stands for a single character. This pattern can match dates that follow the MM-DD-YYYY format, but it can also match strings like ab-cd-efgh.
4. For the Use Placeholder field, select True.This ensures that in the files we generate after comparing texts or documents, excluded date formats will appear as the rule name: ExcludedDate.
5. For the Comparison Rule field, create a new variable using the ctrl + k keyboard shortcut.
