# Description

The Publish Package activity publishes a NuGet package of a UiPath project to a package feed in Orchestrator. It is typically used inside a Stage Activity to better track progress in Automation Ops - Pipelines.

# Configuration



* Tenant - The name of the Orchestrator where the project is published.
* Package path - The local path to the package to be published in Orchestrator.



Common

* Continue on error - (Optional) Specifies if the automation should continue even when the activity throws an error. This field only supports Boolean values (True, False). The default value is False. As a result, if the field is blank and an error is thrown, the execution of the project stops. If the value is set to True, the execution of the project continues regardless of any error.

Input

Folder name - (Optional) Orchestrator folder. If not provided, the Orchestrator Tenant feed will be used. The right Tenant feed will be automatically detected based on the package type.If the published package is a library, then this field can be left blank but you should set the library feed to "Both host and tenant feeds" from the Deployment section in the settings tab at tenant level. Read more about libraries in Orchestrator.

# Exceptions

If the specified feed already contains a package with the same version, the following exception is thrown:

* UiPath.Pipelines.Activities.Core.PackageVersionConflictException

You can handle it if you want your Pipeline to continue execution for this case or set the ContinueOnError flag to continue the job even if an error is thrown.
