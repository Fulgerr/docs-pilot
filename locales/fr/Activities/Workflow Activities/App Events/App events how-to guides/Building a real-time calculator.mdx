# Building a real-time calculator

# Overview

To observe the instant communication between UiPath Apps and UiPath Robot, you would need to:

* Build a project in UiPath Studio that consists of:Main.Xaml - the main workflow used to execute the triggersSeveral app-triggered workflows - used for basic arithmetic operations. These workflows are to be configured as entry points.Arithmetic operationStudio workflowAdditionSum.xamlSubtractionSubtract.xamlMultiplicationMultiply.xamlDivisonDivide.xamlThe trigger workflow - this workflow is available as a template, but you can also create it and customize it to your business needs

* Build an app in UiPath Apps that consists of:Two input controls - where you input your numbersFour buttons controls - configured with the Trigger Workflow rule, to bind the button to a specific arithmetic operation, which is represented by a Studio workflowFour text boxes controls - where the result from the arithmetic operations are sent

### Building the UiPath Studio project

Make sure you are using UiPath Studio versions 2023.4 and above, and UiPath Robot versions 2023.4 and above.

If possible, we recommend configuring the Studio project to Start as a background process. This is helpful to have the same app running simultaneously in multiple browser windows, without throwing errors.


### Building the Apps project

Make sure you are using UiPath Apps with the VB Expressions option enabled.


### Publishing and deploying your app in Orchestrator

To prepare you app for execution, you need to publish it to the Orchestrator tenant feed, and then deploy it.

In Apps, click Publish on the top navigation bar.Switch to Orchestrator and navigate to the desired folder.Go to Automations > Apps and click Deploy app. The Deploy app wizard opens.From the App dropdown, select the previously published app.Click Deploy. Now your app is available in your Orchestrator folder to run.


### Running your app

You are ready to run your app.

In UiPath Assistant, on the Home panel, search for your app under the Apps category.Click Run. You are prompted to grant UiPath Robot Assistant access.Input two numbers.Click a button for the desired arithmetic operation.

The first computation takes longer because it is the first instantiation of the job. After that, the job keeps running and instantly returns the results. When you close the Apps session, the job terminates.
