# Release Notes


## V3.8.0

Release date: 10 March 2025

# Activity for resetting control values

A new activity is now available for the App Events package: Reset Apps Values. This activity is comparable to the Reset Values rule in VB Apps. This activity allows you to reset the value of one or several controls simultaneously, as well as app variables, from within a workflow.

This removes the need to write individual expressions at the control level, and is useful in cases where you want to refresh an interface with default data.

## V2.0.0

Release date: 25 August 2023

# Activities for real-time communication between Apps and attended automations

Two new activities join the App Events pack: Apps Request Trigger and Handle Apps Request. Together with the Trigger Workflow rule in Apps, their mission is clear: enable instantaneous, two-way communication between Apps and attended automations.

This ensures that whenever you start a process from your app, it stays active to facilitate immediate responses. The process concludes upon closing the Apps session.

These activities are included in a dedicated Studio template called Apps - Robot Real Time Communication Sample.

Download this example and see the real-time communication in action.


## V1.0.0

Release date: 9 May 2022

# New features and improvements

The new App Events activities pack contains a new activity, , enabling a communication between UiPath Apps and processes for attended robots. This activity enables you to send interim process results (IPR), reducing the time to display process results.

This pack is meant to be used when the time to start a process is a bottleneck in your automation and you need to wait for an entire automation to complete in order to obtain the process results.
