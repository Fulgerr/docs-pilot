* ContinueOnError - Specifies if the automation should continue even when the activity throws an error. This field supports Boolean values (True, False) only. The default value is False. As a result, if the field is blank and an error is thrown, the execution of the project stops. If the value is set to True, the execution of the project continues regardless of any error.

If this activity is included in Try Catch and the value of the ContinueOnError property is True, no error is caught when the project is executed.

* DisplayName - The display name of the activity.
* TimeoutMS - Specifies the amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait for the activity to run before an error is thrown. The default value is 30000 milliseconds (30 seconds).
