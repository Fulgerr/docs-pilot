# Wait For Form Task And Resume

UiPath.Persistence.Activities.FormTask.WaitForFormTaskAndResume

# Description

Suspends the execution of the current workflow until a specified Action is completed. To designate an Action, a FormTaskData object retrieved from the Create Form Task activity must be supplied. When the Action is completed, the execution of the workflow is resumed.

Warning: When a SecureString variable is mapped back into the workflow, its value will be cleared, because SecureString variables are not serializable by design, in the .NET framework. Any SecureString variables will need to be reassigned.

* ContinueOnError - Specifies if the automation should continue even when the activity throws an error. This field only supports Boolean values (True, False). The default value is False.

* StatusMessage - The message specified in this property field is displayed in Orchestrator alongside the workflow that is suspended by this activity. This field supports strings and String variables only.
* TimeoutMS - Specifies the amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait for the activity to run before an error is thrown. The default value is 30000 milliseconds (30 seconds).
