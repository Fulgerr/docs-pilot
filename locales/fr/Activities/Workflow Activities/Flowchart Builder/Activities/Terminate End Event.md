# Terminate End Event

Terminate End Events terminate all paths in the scope of the process.

Inside a Subprocess, Terminate End Event terminates all paths of the subprocess. After the termination, the subprocess completes, and the parent process continues execution until it reaches its own Terminate End Event.

Use the Terminate End Event when you need to terminate the instance of a specific process scope. The following image showcases how to best use it in conjunction with a Split and Merge. In the case the approval is rejected, you want to terminate the Subprocess execution and handle the recovery on a different path without waiting for the other approval.
