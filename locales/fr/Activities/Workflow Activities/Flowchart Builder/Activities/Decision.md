# Decision

Decisions control the flow of a process based on a condition. Depending on the condition, the process follows one of two paths. The paths are usually labeled True and False, but you can change these names in the Properties panel.

The Decision activity corresponds to the Exclusive Gateway element in BPMN.



# Properties

ConditionWrite the expression for the condition that must be evaluated before continuing the execution of the process. For example, in a process of approving a loan, a condition expression could be "IF age>18 AND salary>50,000". If the condition is met, the loan would be approved. Else, the loan would be rejected.Display nameThe name of the Decision point as you want it to be displayed on the Long Running Workflow canvas.FalseLabelThe indicator for the False branch, when the condition is not met, as you want it to be displayed on the Long Running Workflow canvas.TrueLabelThe indicator for the True branch, when the condition is met, as you want it to be displayed on the Long Running Workflow canvas.

# Managing the Decision

To configure a Decision activity in your process:

1. Add the Decision activity to your canvas.
2. In the Condition field, write the expression for the condition.
3. Add an activity and link it to the Decision. This is the True branch, which executes the configured activity when the condition is met.
4. Optionally, add another activity and link it to the Decision. This is the False branch, which executes the configured activity when the condition is not met.
