# Start Event

The Start Event activity is available by default when you create a new Long Running Workflow. It is the event node that marks the point where the process execution begins.

The Long Running Workflow canvas allows only one Start Event at any time. You can move the Start Event on the canvas and change its type, but you cannot delete it. By default, the process has no triggers. To start it automatically:

* Schedule it through a Time Trigger activity.
* Trigger it from external sources using API events (Integration Service activities, Productivity activities, System activities).
