# Error Boundary Event

Error Boundary Events catch exceptions thrown inside a Task or Subprocess, stop the executions inside the Task or Subprocess, and redirects the executions of the process to recovery. From an Error Boundary Event, you can configure to resume the execution, or to end it once the error is fixed. A Task or Subprocess can have none, one, or multiple Error Boundary Events as long as the Exception Type is different from the others.

You can attach Error Boundary Events to Tasks or Subprocesses exlusively.



# Use case

Use the Error Boundary Event activity when you:

* Need to catch an error for a single, specific Task.
* Have a simple error handling logic that involves one Task.

For example, for a Send Invoice task, the Error Boundary Event:

* Catches a failure
* Routes the process to either:Retry the task, orNotify the finance team and continue execution.
