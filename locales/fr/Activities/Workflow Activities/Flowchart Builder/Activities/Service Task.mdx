# Service Task

Service tasks are executed by a system or service without human intervention. Use them for automated operations, such as data processing, calling external APIs, or executing system functions. They leverage the Invoke Workflow File activity, which is configurable directly from the Properties panel.

The Service Task activity is recommended for data processing, data extraction using Document Understanding, or login operations. It helps break the process into manageable, executable blocks.



# Managing the Service Task

To add the execution of an external application to your process:

1. Add the Service Task activity to your canvas. This automatically displays the Invoke Workflow File activity in the Properties panel.
2. Configure the activity properties as needed. See more details about the Invoke Workflow File activity.
