# User Task

Use the User Task activity when the step within the process requires user interaction, such as entering data, reviewing information, or decision-making operations. This activity suspends the process execution until the task is completed.

A User Task activity leverages activities from Action Center, including the Approval Task template. The recommended design is:

Create an Action Center App Task.Assign the task to one or more users and notify them via Slack, Microsoft Teams, or other communication channels.Set timers for completion with rules (for instance, notify or reassign)Suspend execution until the User Task is complete.
