# LookUpDataTable

This method emulates the behaviour of the VLOOKUP Excel formula. It enables you to search
            for a provided value in a specified DataTable and returns the
                RowIndex at which it was found. If the provided value is not found, then the
            returned RowIndex is -1. This method can also help you return the value found in
            the cell that has the row coordinates specified in the RowIndex parameter and the
            column coordinates specified in the Target Column property category.

                    RowIndex property and the Column coordinates specified in the Target
                    Column property category. The output type matches the source data type.
