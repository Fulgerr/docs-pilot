# DeleteQueueItems

Enables you to delete items with the New state from a specified Orchestrator queue. Please note that in order
            to execute this method in Studio, the Robot has to be connected to Orchestrator and
                the Robot role needs Edit,
                Create, and Delete permissions on queues and Delete permissions
            on transactions. When this method is run, it uses the same authentication context as the
            Robot which executes it, inheriting its permissions.
