# SetCredential

Enables you to update the value of an indicated credential asset, that is already
            available in Orchestrator, be it a global or a Per Robot asset. Click here for details on assets.

Note that to execute this method, the Robot role needs to have Edit
            permissions on assets. When this method is run, it uses the same authentication context
            as the Robot which executes it, inheriting its permissions.
