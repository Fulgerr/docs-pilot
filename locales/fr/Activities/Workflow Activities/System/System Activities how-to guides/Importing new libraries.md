# Importing new libraries

For scenarios where you need to use specific libraries and some specific namespaces that they provide in your project, others than the default ones that come with the installation of UiPath Studio, you can import them in your project.

### Importing new libraries in Studio Desktop

To add a new library when you work in Studio Desktop:

Select the Manage Packages menu from the toolbar, or use CTRL+P.Select the feed where your library is hosted, such as the Official feed, Nuget, or Orchestrator Tenant.Select the library, then click Install.Once installed, you need to add the namespaces of the library:Select the Imports tab at the lower-left part of the Main panel in Studio.Search for the namespaces you want to use in your workflow.To add the desired namespace to the list, select it. This makes the namespace available at runtime.Save your project.


### Importing new libraries in Studio Web

To add a new library when you work in Studio Web:

In the Automations tab, identify the project where you want to import the new library.Select the See more menu for the desired project, then select Open in Studio Desktop.Follow the steps from Importing new libraries in Studio Desktop.To synchronize the changes made in Studio Desktop to the same project in Studio Web, select Cloud Project > Sync to Cloud in the status bar.Return to your project in Studio Web and run it.


### Example: Using the RestSharp library in the Invoke Code activity

Say you need to execute the following C# code snippet with the Invoke Code activity:var client=new RestClient("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com");Where RestClient is a class in the RestSharp namespace.For the previous snippet to execute successfully, you need to install the RestSharp library and import the RestSharp namespace in your project.If your project is in Studio Web, follow the steps from Importing new libraries in Studio Web.If your project is in Studio Desktop, follow the steps from Importing new libraries in Studio Desktop.Select the Azure feed, then search for the RestSharp library and install it. The RestSharp library should be displayed in the Dependencies tree of the Project panel.If the Official feed does not display your library, you need to add the feed where the library may be hosted.In the Main window, switch to the Imports tab at the lower-left part.Search for the generic RestSharp namespace. Select it to add it to the namespaces list.Execute the activity.
