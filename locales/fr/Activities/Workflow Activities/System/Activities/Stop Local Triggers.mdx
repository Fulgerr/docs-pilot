# Stop Local Triggers

UiPath.Core.Activities.StopTriggers

# Description

This activity is used to terminate the execution of local triggers. When executed, it
                cancels all ongoing actions, including workflows triggered by events. When Stop
                    Local Triggers executes, ongoing event-triggered workflows are canceled, but
                the activities in the main workflow continue as usual.

Note that any activities placed after Stop Local Triggers in the same workflow
                won't run. Instead, the execution proceeds to the next activity after a Run Local
                    Triggers activity. Typically, Run Local Triggers and Stop Local
                    Triggers are in separate workflows. Executing Stop Local Triggers
                shifts execution to the Run Local Triggers workflow, where the next activity
                runs.

You can use the activity inside the sequence itself, or invoke it from a different
                workflow using the invoke workflow file activity.
