# Raise Alert

UiPath.Core.Activities.RaiseAlert

# Description

Helps you add custom alerts in Orchestrator, with a selected severity. If you have all the
        necessary settings configured in Orchestrator to
            receive e-mail alerts, the alert raised with this activity at the
          Fatal or Error severity, are also included in e-mails. Please note that in
        order to execute this activity in Studio, the Robot has to be connected to Orchestrator and
          the Robot role needs to have
        the View, Create and Edit permissions on Alerts. The activity runs
        under the Robot which executes it.

Misc

* FolderPath - The path of the folder where the alert should be raised, if different from the folder where the process is running. This field only supports string values, with / as the separator to indicate subfolders. For example "Finance/Accounts Payable".
* Private - If selected, the values of variables and arguments are no longer logged at Verbose level.The FolderPath parameter does not work for processes executed by robots in classic folders. Only robots in modern folders have the ability to pass data outside of their folder.Relative folder paths are supported in an X-UIPATH-FolderPath-Encoded header, as follows:-right: Path starting with / - starts from the root folder of the tree the ambient folder is part of.-right: Path starting with . - starts from the ambient folder.-right: Path starting with .. - starts one level up in the hierarchy of the ambient folder for each .. in the path (e.g. ../ for one level up, ../../ for two levels up in the hierarchy).Note that trailing slashes are not accepted.
