# Track Object

UiPath.Core.Activities.ProcessTracking.TrackObject

# Description

The Track Object activity allows the Process Tracking Scope activity to track a task in an existing trace. In Process Mining, you can analyse data about the objects attached to a task or trace.

The following example describes the steps in an Invoice Processing workflow and how the Track Object activity can help:

Step 1: Receiving an invoiceWhen an invoice is received, you use the Track Object activity to start the invoice (the object) tracking and sent the data to Process Mining. The following properties are set:Object ID: "INV-2025-001"Object type: "Invoice"Object interaction: CreateObject properties: {"Vendor": "Acme Corp", "Amount": "5000", "Date": "2025-02-10"}Step 2: Validating the invoiceAfter validating the invoice details, you use a second Track Object activity to mark that invoice details have been updated:Object ID: "INV-2025-001"Object type: "Invoice"Object interaction: UpdateObject properties: {"ValidationStatus": "Passed", "ValidatedBy": "AutoBot1"}Step 3: Processing the paymentWhen initiating payment, you use a third Track Object activity to mark that invoice payment details have been updated:Object ID: "INV-2025-001"Object type: "Invoice"Object interaction: UpdateObject properties: {"PaymentStatus": "Initiated", "PaymentDate": "2025-02-15"}Step 4: Final recordingAfter payment confirmation, you use a fourth Track Object activity to update the invoice with its final details:Object ID: "INV-2025-001"Object type: "Invoice"Object interaction: UpdateObject properties: {"Status": "Completed", "CompletionDate": "2025-02-16"}

You can connect two automations through the business item or object they both operate with. For example, automation A1 creates the object using the Track Object activity, giving it a name, a type, and the Object interaction is Created. In a separate automation A2, you reference the same object using the Track Object activity, where you use the same object name and type. The interaction for automation A2 is different than Created, as the second automation updates the object. The collected data about the object is sent to Process Mining for analysis.
