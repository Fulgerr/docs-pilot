* Queue Name - The queue where to select the schema definition from. The name is case insensitive, meaning that if in Orchestrator it was defined as "MyFirstQueue", it matches "myfirstqueue". The maximum number of characters is 50.
* Analytics - A collection of analytics information about the specific TransactionItem whose status is to be updated.
* Output - A collection of additional information about the specific TransactionItem whose status is to be updated. Setting the Output property for failed transactions is only possible when connected to a 2022.10 and newer versions of Orchestrator.

Others

* Timeout (milliseconds) - Specifies the amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait for the activity to run before an error is thrown. The default value is 30000 milliseconds (30 seconds).
* Continue On Error - Specifies to continue executing the remaining activities even if the current activity failed. This field only supports Boolean values (True, False). The default value is False.

Transaction Error

* Details - Details regarding the failed Transaction. This field supports only strings and String variables. You can place any log information or other details about the failure.
* ErrorType - The error type that the failed Transaction has thrown. Application - a technical issue (e.g. a file that cannot be found), this type of error will retry the transaction according to the settings in Orchestrator, Business - an error regarding an external factor (e.g. an invoice that could not be paid). For more information on this choice, see the Business Exception vs Application Exception article.
* Reason - The reason for which the Transaction failed. This field supports only strings and String variables. You can place any short reason here (e.g. does not contain the letter F).

Only robots in modern folders have the ability to pass data outside of their folder.Relative folder paths are supported in an X-UIPATH-FolderPath-Encoded header, as follows:-right: Path starting with / - starts from the root folder of the tree the ambient folder is part of.-right: Path starting with . - starts from the ambient folder.-right: Path starting with .. - starts one level up in the hierarchy of the ambient folder for each .. in the path (e.g. ../ for one level up, ../../ for two levels up in the hierarchy).Note that trailing slashes are not accepted.
* Private - If selected, the values of variables and arguments are no longer logged at Verbose level.
