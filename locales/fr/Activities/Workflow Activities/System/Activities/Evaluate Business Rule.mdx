# Evaluate Business Rule

UiPath.Core.Activities.EvaluateBusinessRule

# Description

Allows users to consume Decision Model and Notation (DMN) files, known as Business rule objects in Orchestrator.

The activity supports DMN version 1.3 files, which use S-FEEL (Simple - Friendly Enough Expression Language) expressions.While creating the DMN file, ensure that argument names consist only of letters, digits, and the underscore character. Names must begin with a letter or the underscore character.

In a DMN file, input arguments are the conditions that trigger a specific output. The Evaluate Business Rule activity automatically populates in the input and output arguments based on the selected DMN file, or business rule. The most recent version of the business rule in Orchestrator is always used.

DMN arguments have different data types, which are converted by the activity, as follows:
