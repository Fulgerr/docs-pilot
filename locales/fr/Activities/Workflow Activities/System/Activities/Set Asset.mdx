# Set Asset

UiPath.Core.Activities.SetAsset

# Description

Enables you to update the value of an indicated asset, which is already available in Orchestrator, be it a global or a Per Robot asset. Please note that to execute this activity, the Robot role needs to have Edit permissions on assets. When the UiPath.Core.Activities.SetAsset is triggered, the authentication context of the Robot under which it runs is being used.

For more information about Global and Per Robot assets, please see steps 5 and 6 from this page.

* Orchestrator folder path - The path of the folder where the asset is located, if different from the folder where the process is running. This field only supports string values, with / as the separator to indicate subfolders. For example "Finance/Accounts Payable".
* Asset Name - The name of the asset to be updated. Selecting Manage assets redirects you to the Assets page of the connected Orchestrator instance.
* Value - The new value you want the asset to have. The type needs to coincide with the type of asset you want to update. This property cannot be empty.







Additional options

Others

* Timeout (milliseconds) - Specifies the amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait for the activity to run before an error is thrown. The default value is 30000 milliseconds (30 seconds).
* Continue on error - Specifies if the automation should continue even when the activity throws an error. This field only supports Boolean values (true, false). The default value is false. As a result, if the field is not configured and an error is thrown, the execution of the project stops. If the value is set to true, the execution of the project continues regardless of any error.

Properties

Common

* Continue On Error - Specifies if the automation should continue even when the activity throws an error. This field only supports Boolean values (true, false). The default value is false. As a result, if the field is blank and an error is thrown, the execution of the project stops. If the value is set to true, the execution of the project continues regardless of any error.
* DisplayName - The display name of the activity.
* Timeout(milliseconds) - Specifies the amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait for the activity to run before an error is thrown. The default value is 30000 milliseconds (30 seconds).

Input

* AssetName - The name of the asset to be updated. The name has to be exactly the same as the one in Orchestrator, and the same capitalization has to be used.
* Value - The new value you want the asset to have. The type needs to coincide with the type of asset you want to update. This property cannot be empty.

Misc

* Folder Path - The path of the folder where the asset is located, if different from the folder where the process is running. This field only supports string values, with / as the separator to indicate subfolders. For example "Finance/Accounts Payable".
* Private - If selected, the values of variables and arguments are no longer logged at Verbose level.The FolderPath parameter does not work for processes executed by robots in classic folders. Only robots in modern folders have the ability to pass data outside of their folder.Relative folder paths are supported in an X-UIPATH-FolderPath-Encoded header, as follows:Path starting with / - starts from the root folder of the tree the ambient folder is part of.Path starting with . - starts from the ambient folder.Path starting with .. - starts one level up in the hierarchy of the ambient folder for each .. in the path (e.g. ../ for one level up, ../../ for two levels up in the hierarchy).Trailing slashes are not accepted.
