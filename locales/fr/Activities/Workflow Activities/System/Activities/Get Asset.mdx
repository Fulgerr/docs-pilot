# Get Asset

UiPath.Core.Activities.GetRobotAsset

# Description

Gets a specified Orchestrator asset by using a provided AssetName. If the asset is not global, it must be assigned to the local robot in order to be retrieved. The activity uses the same authentication context as the Robot under which it runs. For more information about global assets, you can access About Assets.

* Orchestrator folder path - The path of the folder where the asset is located and must be retrieved from, if different from the folder where the process is running. This field only supports string values, with / as the separator to indicate subfolders. For example "Finance/Accounts Payable".
* Asset Name - The name of the asset to be retrieved. Selecting Manage assets redirects you to the Assets page of the connected Orchestrator instance.





Additional options

Misc

* Timeout (milliseconds) - Specifies the amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait for the activity to run before an error is thrown. The default value is 30000 milliseconds (30 seconds).
* CacheStrategy - Specifies the period of time retrieved values are cached. By default, all requests are forwarded to Orchestrator. The available options are None and Execution. Choosing Execution caches the Orchestrator Asset and uses it for the whole process execution.

Output

* Value - Reference to the retrieved asset. The system automatically sets the Output value to have the same data type as the Asset Name. For example, if the Asset Name is a String, the Output is set to String type automatically. When you use a variable to specify the Asset Name, the system cannot automatically determine the data type because the variable value might change at runtime. In this case, you need to manually specify the data type for the Output.

* DisplayName - The display name of the activity.

Input

* Asset Name - The name of the asset to be retrieved.

Misc

* Orchestrator Folder Path - The path of the folder where the asset is located and must be retrieved from, if different from the folder where the process is running. This field only supports string values, with / as the separator to indicate subfolders. For example "Finance/Accounts Payable".The FolderPath parameter does not work for processes executed by robots in classic folders. Only robots in modern folders have the ability to pass data outside of their folder.Relative folder paths are supported in an `X-UIPATH-FolderPath-Encoded` header, as follows:Path starting with `/` - starts from the `root` folder of the tree the ambient folder is part of.Path starting with `.` - starts from the ambient folder.Path starting with `..` - starts one level up in the hierarchy of the ambient folder for each `..` in the path (e.g. `../` for one level up, ../../ for two levels up in the hierarchy).Note that trailing slashes are not accepted.
* Private - If selected, the values of variables and arguments are no longer logged at Verbose level.

Output

* Value - Reference to the retrieved asset.The system cannot automatically determine the data type for Output based on the Asset Name value. You need to manually specify the data type for the output value to match the retrieved asset type.
