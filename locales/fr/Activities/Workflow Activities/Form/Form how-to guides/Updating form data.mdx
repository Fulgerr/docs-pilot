# Updating form data

This tutorial demonstrates how to change form values at
            runtime, while the form is showing. You can achieve this using the Continue Workflow
                Execution feature inside the Show Form activity and using the Set Form
                Values, and Form Trigger activities. This example demonstrates how to
            build a form with a counter that can be incremented or decremented by clicking buttons
            within the form.

(Optional) Create a folder called CounterForm. This is where you want to
                    store the uiform file and the corresponding trigger workflows.Create a new form called Counter.uiform and place it inside the
                        Counter folder.(Optional) Add a Columns component, with three columns that have
                            the following widths: 2, 6, and 2.Add a Number component inside the middle column, and set the
                            label as Number, and the Default value to
                            1.Add two Button components in the other columns, and set the
                            labels as:increasedecreaseIn the Main.xaml workflow add a Show Form activity and select
                        Counter.uiformAdd a Run Local Triggers activity.Create a trigger workflow that activates when the user clicks on the
                        increase button.Add a Form Trigger Activity and select Increase
                            clicked.Add a Get Form Values activity to retrieve the value of the
                                number.Add an Assign activity to and add it by 1.Add a Set Form Values activity to pass the value back into the
                            form.Create a trigger workflow that activates when the user clicks on the
                        decrease button.Add a Form Trigger Activity and select Decrease
                            clicked.Add a Get Form Values activity to retrieve the value of the
                                number.Add an Assign activity to and subtract it by 1.Add a Set Form Values activity to pass the value back into the
                            form.
