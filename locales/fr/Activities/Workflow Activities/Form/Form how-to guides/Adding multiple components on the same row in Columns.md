# Adding multiple components on the same row in Columns

You can use the Columns component to group other form
      components into columns that you can configure. If you want to display multiple components in
      one line, and generated across multiple rows, use the Columns component. This can be
      useful to gather user data when the form is displayed on small width screens.

Open or create a Form in Studio.Add a Columns component.For the Column Properties section, add how many columns you need.No matter how many columns yo add, make sure that the total
              Width of your columns equals 12, so the columns won't spill under to the
            next line.Start adding form components inside your columns.
