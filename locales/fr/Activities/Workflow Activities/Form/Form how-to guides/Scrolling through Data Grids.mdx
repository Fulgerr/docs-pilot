# Scrolling through Data Grids

When you create a Data Grid with more than 12
                Text Field components inside of it, the Data Grid becomes too tight to
            display the content. This tutorial shows how to scroll through the Data Grid, and make
            the components inside of it wider, so the content becomes more readable.

Go to the Properties panel of the form where you want to add the Data
                        Grid. In the Custom CSS field, input the following CSS classes:.my-data-grid
{
   overflow-x: scroll;
}
 
 
.my-data-grid-input 
{
   min-width: 6000px;
}The overflow-x: scroll property allows you to scroll through
                    the Data Grid. The min-width: 300px property makes
                        Text Fields inside a Data Grid larger, to display the content inside
                    of them.Add a Data Grid component into the form.In the Display tab, add the custom CSS classes, inside the Custom CSS
                        Class field. Add both classes with a single space between them.

The image below shows how a Data Grid with 12 Text
                Fields looks like.Now you can compare it with the Data Grid below, after applying the
                custom CSS.
