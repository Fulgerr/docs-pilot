### Create Form

UiPath.Form.Activities.FormActivity

# Description

Use this activity to create a custom form. The form you configure retrieves all the data the end user inputs and stores it in variables, which can be further used in the automation process. The Do block in the activity enables you to perform additional actions when the form opens or while the form is running.

* Folder Path (String) - Enter the path where you want to save the form data to.
* Form Name (String) - Enter a name for your form data.

Warning: To bind every Create Form to the corresponding Start Form Activity, the Folder Path and Form Name values must match with the values set in Start Form Activity > Create Form properties.


### Start Form Activity

UiPath.Form.Activities.StartFormActivity

# Description

Use this activity to open a form in the background. At runtime, this cuts down the waiting time for the form to open.

The activity must be paired with the Create Form activity in the same or a different workflow. In case of multiple forms, assign a Start Form Activity to every Create Form activity.

# Project compatibility

Windows - Legacy | Windows

# Windows, Windows - Legacy configuration

Pairing a form with the Start Form Activity causes some of the form properties to be unavailable, such as ExecuteDoBlockFirst, WindowPositionX, WindowPositionY etc.

### Trigger Form Button

UiPath.Form.Activities.TriggerFormButton

# Description

Use this activity to trigger the execution of the Do block of an external process.

You provide the ID of the process you want to execute externally and the key of the button that executes the Do block in the external form. At runtime, the activity searches for the indicated form process ID and clicks on the specified button key to execute the Do block. To find out a Form Process Id, use the Output field of the Start Form Activity in the corresponding workflow.

* Form Process Id (Int32) - Enter the ID of the process that generates the form containing the triggering button. You can retrieve the process ID through the Output field of the Start Activity. Make sure you are in the correct process when you use this option, as you need to collect the ID of the process that needs to be triggered externally.

* Private (Boolean) - To skip logging variables and arguments at Verbose level, check this box. By default, the checkbox is cleared (set to false).

# Workflow example

The example below demonstrates how to configure trigger form buttons.

1. For example, you design a button (Approve) in the Form1 form of the Process1 process. While in Process1, make sure to check the following:You use "approve" as the Field Key value of the button component. You use the Start Form activity to retrieve the Process1 process ID: you create a variable process_id in the activity Output > Form Process Id field.
2. You have another process, called Process2, and you need it to trigger the Approve button of the Form1 form (which is generated by the Process1 process). Process1 is a process external to Process2. While in Process2, make sure to check the following:You use the Trigger Form Button activity. For the Button Key property, enter the field key of the Approve button from Process1 (for example, "approve"). For the Form Process Id, enter the Process1 process ID returned by the Start Activity (for example, the variable process_id).

Result: The Trigger Form Button activity searches for the indicated
                process ID and clicks on the specified button, thus executing the Do block in
                the Form1 form (externally triggered from Process2).
