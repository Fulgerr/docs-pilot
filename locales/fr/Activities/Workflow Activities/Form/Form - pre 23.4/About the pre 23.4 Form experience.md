# About the pre 23.4 Form experience

To connect and share data between UiPath Studio, UiPath Assistant, and
            UiPath.Form.Activities, the package uses an internal Data Connector
            Mechanism.

To generate schemas from NuGet Packages or from custom data, including user-defined data
            types in UiPath Data Service, the Form activity package uses a built-in schema generator
            logic.

The UiPath Form Designer found in the activity package is a customized
            implementation of the form.io engine that provides a drag
            and drop form builder experience in Studio. The UiPath Form Designer
            functionality complies with internal security requirements.
