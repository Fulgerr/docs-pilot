# Callout Designer Editor

# Overview

The UiPath Callout Designer is a powerful tool that enables developers to create visually appealing and intuitive callout interfaces with ease. Built on the form.io engine, this feature-rich custom implementation is designed to streamline the callout design process within UiPath Studio.

As an RPA developer, you can leverage the Callout Designer to rapidly create callout interfaces that are essential for both attended and unattended automations. By using the drag-and-drop interface, you can quickly assemble the necessary fields for each callout, specifying their respective behaviors, definitions, and validation rules. This allows you to customize every aspect of the callout fields, ensuring the needs of your automation processes.

Whether you are building callouts for inputting user data or retrieving information from an external system, the Callout Designer provides a flexible and user-friendly interface that makes the process both simple and efficient. To access the Callout Designer, all you need to do is click Design Callout inside the Callout Designer activity, and you're ready to start building.

### Callout components

A Callout component provides user interaction and collects user data.

The UI components are grouped into categories, based on their functionality, as
            follows:


| Form Component Category | Description | Form Component |
| --- --- ---| Basic | Contains the most used callout fields. | Text FieldText AreaNumberCheckboxSelect BoxesLabel/HeaderDrop-down ListRadioButton |
| Advanced | Contains personal or period data. | HTML ElementContentUrlDate / TimeDayTimeCurrency |
| Layout | Contains elements that alter the layout of the form. | ColumnsPanelTable |

To create a custom callout, drag the desired UI components, drop them to the right side
            panel, and arrange them to the logic of your use-case.

# Customizing Callout
                Components

Once you drop a callout component, a configuration wizard opens in the Callout
                Designer. The configuration wizard displays tabs that allow further customization
                for various functionalities. Check the progress in the preview pane of the
                wizard.

When you are satisfied with a component design, click Save.

The table below describes the settings available for the common configuration wizard
                tabs.

Wizard TabDescriptionSpecial MentionsDisplayIn this tab, you configure the way the callout component is
                                    displayed.The name you set in the mandatory Label field is passed as
                                    the PropertyName in the Field Key tab.DataIn this tab, you configure a default value that end users see in
                                    the text field.For components that can hold multiple items (e.g.,
                                        Selectboxes, Tab), you define them in this
                                    tab.ValidationIn this tab, you configure validation requirements to enable
                                    other callout components.Field KeyIn this tab, you configure the component name you want to use
                                    further in the workflow.By default, this value is passed from the Label field of
                                    the Display tab.ConditionalIn this tab, you configure conditions for the component.You can set advanced conditions, such as Javascript or
                                    JSONLogic.LogicIn this tab, you configure the logic that triggers the
                                    conditions.

Not all callout components
                        have all the configuration wizard tabs available.The Content Component
                        is not available offline, because it needs to make a CDN call over the
                        internet to load the Rich Text Editor.To add an image in the
                            HTML Element component, convert the image to Base64 format.

Some callout components have specific tabs, for example:

ComponentWizard TabDescriptionDate / TimeDateIn this tab, you configure the minimum and maximum date available
                                    for selection.TimeIn this tab, you configure the incremental step for hours and
                                    minutes.DayDayIn this tab, you configure the way the business user selects the
                                    day (incremental or from a drop-down list).MonthIn this tab, you configure the way the business user selects the
