# About the Credentials activity package

The Credentials activity pack has been made open-source. Feel free to collaborate on our Github repositories.

The Credentials Activities Pack contains activities that work with Windows Credential Manager, enabling the adding and deleting of credentials for specific Microsoft authentication packages, such as NTLM, Kerberos, Negotiate, Schannel, or Passport.

Robots can also use these activities to retrieve credentials or simply prompt a human user to introduce his credentials, for later usage.When converting a Windows - Legacy project to the Windows compatibility, activities that are part of the Credentials activities package version 1.1 and lower will become unresolved when updating the package to a newer version and need to be added again to the workflow after the conversion.
