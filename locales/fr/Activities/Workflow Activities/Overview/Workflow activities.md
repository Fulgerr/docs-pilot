# Workflow activities

Activities that are part of the Workflow category allow you to build basic automation projects using logical operators and expressions, communicate directly with Orchestrator or other web services, interact with entities available in Data Service, and many more.

Some of the most common use cases are:

* Create the base workflow or test cases.
* Manipulate data tables by adding or extracting information.
* Use of credentials for specific Microsoft authentication processes.
* Trigger specific actions in the workflow according to specific events.
* Build and design custom callouts to guide users through attended automations.
* Set up a continuous-integration/continuous-delivery (CI/CD) system to manage the automation projects code.
