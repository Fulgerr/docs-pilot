# About the FTP activity package

The FTP activity package has
            been made open-source. Feel free to collaborate on our Github repositories.

The FTP activity package enables the user to connect to a File Transfer Protocol server and
            perform all the fundamental actions within it, such as searching, downloading,
            uploading, deleting, or creating, both for files and directories.

The FTP Scope activity is a container designed to enable the user to connect to an FTP Server, perform multiple actions and then disconnect from the server.

The connection to the server can be stored in an FtpSessionGen variable. This variable is unique for each File Transfer Protocol server you connect to and can be reused to connect to the server as many times as desired.

# Supported encryption methods and
                                algorithms

The FTP activity package supports all encryption methods and algorithms provided by
                                the SSH.NET library.
