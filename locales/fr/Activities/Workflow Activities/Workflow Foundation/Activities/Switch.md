# Switch

System.Activities.Statements.Switch

Enables you to execute a single course of action out of multiple options, based on a specified condition. The activity consists of a conditional expression and a collection of cases, each containing a corresponding activity or set of activities. The Switch activity executes a single case in the collection, based on its match with the conditional expression. If the condition does not match any of the cases, the Default one is executed. The Switch activity can be used instead of an If activity if the condition has to be tested against three or more cases.
