# Setting up Kerberos authentication


### Prerequisites

To successfully set up Kerberos authentication, you must meet the following prerequisites:

* Ensuring the Automation Suite cluster can access your AD
* Configuring the AD service account for Kerberos authentication
* Optional: SQL
                                                authentication prerequisites


### Configuring Automation Suite as a Kerberos client

This section explains how you can configure Automation Suite as a Kerberos client for LDAP or SQL access.

With <KERB_DEFAULT_KEYTAB>, configure Automation Suite as a Kerberos client in one of the following ways:

* Configuring Kerberos authentication via the interactive installer
* Configuring Kerberos authentication via cluster_config.json

Currently, we allow independent configuration of only user authentication by setting kerberos_auth_config.enabled to true and kerberos_auth_config.enable_integrated_sql_auth to false. Independent SQL authentication is still not supported.


### Configuring the Active Directory integration

For Kerberos authentication to be used when logging in to Automation Suite, you must further configure Automation Suite host settings.


### Disabling Kerberos authentication
