# Step 2: Deploying the Quick Start
        template

This page explains how to choose your deployment option and how to create the stack.

You are responsible for the cost of the AWS services used while running this Quick Start reference deployment. There is no additional cost for using this Quick Start.For full details, see the pricing pages for each AWS service used by this Quick Start. Prices are subject to change.

Now that you have configured the AWS account, sign in to that account at https://aws.amazon.com with an IAM user role with the necessary permissions.

The following sections walk you through the steps you need to take to launch the Quick Start and create the stack.

### Deployment options

This Quick Start provides two deployment options:

* Deploy UiPath® Automation Suite into a new VPC . This option builds a new AWS environment which consists of the VPC, subnets, NAT gateways, security groups, bastion hosts, and other infrastructure components. The UiPath® Automation Suite is then deployed directly into this new VPC. To set up the networking and routing infrastructure, you only provide the CIDR block for the VPC that you want to create.
* Deploy UiPath® Automation Suite into an existing VPC . With this option, resources are provisioned into an existing AWS VPC, and Automation Suite is deployed there. If you use AWS GovCloud, you must deploy Automation Suite into an existing VPC. For more requirements, see Preparing an AWS GovCloud deployment.

Each deployment takes about 1 hour and 25 minutes to complete.

You have the following options for launching the AWS CloudFormation template:


| Options | Template |
| --- ---| Deploy UiPath® Automation                                         Suite into a new VPC on AWS | View                                         template |
| Deploy UiPath®                                         Automation Suite into an existing VPC on AWS | View                                         template |

Check if the AWS Region displayed in the upper-right corner of the navigation bar is correct. This Region is where the network infrastructure for Automation Suite is built. The template is launched in the us-east-1 Region by default.

Here are the deployment parameters you need for the templates.


### Creating the stack

On the Create stack page, keep the default setting for the template URL, and then choose Next.On the Specify stack details page, change the stack name if needed. Review the parameters for the template. Provide values for the parameters that require input. For all other parameters, review the default settings and customize them as necessary. For details on each parameter, see AWS deployment parameters. After reviewing and customizing the parameters, choose Next.On the Configure stack options page, you can specify tags (key-value pairs) for resources in your stack and set advanced options. When you finish, choose Next.On the Review page, review and confirm the template settings. Under Capabilities, select the two check boxes to acknowledge that the template creates IAM resources and might require the ability to automatically expand macros.Choose Create stack to deploy the stack.Monitor the status of the stack. When the status is CREATE_COMPLETE, the UiPath® Automation Suite deployment is ready.To view the created resources, see the values displayed in the Outputs tab for the stack.
