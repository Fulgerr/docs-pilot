# RKE2 server fails to start

# Description

The server fails to start. There are a few different reasons for RKE2 not starting properly, which are usually found in the logs.

# Solution

Check the logs using the following commands:

journalctl -u rke2-server

Possible reasons (based on logs): too many learner members in cluster

Too many etcd servers are added to the cluster, and there are two learner nodes trying to be promoted. More information here: Runtime reconfiguration.

Perform the following:

1. Under normal circumstances, the node should become a full member if enough time is allowed.
2. An uninstall-reinstall cycle can be attempted.

Alternatively, this could be caused by a networking problem. Ensure you have configured the machine to enable the necessary ports.
