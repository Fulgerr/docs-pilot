# Step 4: Creating an Azure storage account

If you use external storage, you must create an Azure storage account. If dependent on object storage, each service uses a container with its own specifications.In the installation process, the default option is to give the installer access to the storage account so that it can create the required containers. As an alternative option, you can also create the containers manually using the default container names.To create an Azure storage account, take the following steps:

Go to Storage Account from the home page and select Create.Fill in required details, and select Review.Select Create to create the storage account.Wait until the deployment is complete.
