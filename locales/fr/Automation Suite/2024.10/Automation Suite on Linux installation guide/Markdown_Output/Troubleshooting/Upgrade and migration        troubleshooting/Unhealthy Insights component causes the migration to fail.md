# Unhealthy Insights component causes the migration to fail

# Description

During Longhorn migration, the Insights component may take longer to complete than expected, resulting in migration failure with the "Migration failed to complete in 4500 seconds" error.

# Solution 1

Make sure the Insights component is healthy in ArgoCD, then rerun the following migration command:

./configureUiPathAS.sh longhorn migrate --excluded registry

It may take up to 10 minutes to get to the
                healthy status.

If the Insights component does not turn healthy, rerun the previous command, then select Yes when prompted to rollback the migration. Reach out to support to troubleshoot the Insights component.
