# uipathctl manifest diff

# Description

Load the configuration provided as argument and compare it to the configuration found live in the cluster.

Without any flags, only the manifest is compared,whereas cluster-wide configurations and dependencies are ignored.

The output is always YAML. By default, the diff command available in your path runs with the -u (unified diff), -N(treat absent files as empty), and --color (color output). Add the --no-color flag to disable color output.
