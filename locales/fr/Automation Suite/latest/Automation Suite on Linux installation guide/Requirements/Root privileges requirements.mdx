# Root privileges requirements

You need root privileges (sudo su) to deploy Automation Suite. The following sections describe the specific components that require root access and why they require it.

## Node configuration

The following components require root access to configure the machines to install Automation Suite. This is required because the default partitioning structure on RHEL machines is not suitable for installing Kubernetes. All of these components are required on all nodes.


| Component | Why is root required to execute? |
| --- ---| parted | Required to update the partition structure. |
| pvresize | Required to resize physical volume. |
| lvextend | Required to extend logical volume. |
| xfs_growfs | Required to expand an XFS filesystem. |
| mkfs.ext4 | Required to build a Linux filesystem. |
| mount | Required to mount a filesystem. |


## Deployment

The following components are required to execute the Automation Suite installer at the time of installation. All Linux components require root to be installed.


| Component | Node(s) the component is required for |
| --- ---| helm | Server and Agent |
| argocd | Server |
| jq | Server and Agent |
| curl | Server and Agent |
| openssl | Server and Agent |
| uuidd | Server and Agent |
| nc | Server and Agent |
| httpd-tools | Server and Agent |
| iscsi-initiator-utils | Server and Agent |
| iscsid | Server and Agent |
| rke2 services with Kubernetes | Server and Agent |
| podman1 | Server |

1 Only required for offline installation


## Runtime

Of the components that were installed, the following run as root during normal Automation Suite cluster operations.


| Component | Node(s) the compenent is required | Why is root required to execute? |
| --- --- ---| iscsi-initiator-utils | Server and Agent | Required to provide the server daemon for the Internet Small Computer System Interface (iSCSI) protocol, as well as the utility programs used to manage it. |
| iscsid | Server and Agent | Required to implement the control path for iSCSI protocol for distributing disk access using SCSI commands sent over Internet Protocol networks, plus some management facilities. |
| rke2 services with Kubernetes | Server and Agent | Required to configure containers and networking rules in the Kubernetes distribution.Learn more |
