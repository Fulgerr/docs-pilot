# Configuring appSettings

The Orchestrator configuration consists of an array of Kubernetes config maps and secrets that are loaded in a specific order, and placed in the appSettings section of config maps.The latest configuration is loaded from the orchestrator-customconfig config map. Any newly loaded configuration overwrites all existing settings that have the same key. To display the current custom Orchestrator configuration, use the config orchestrator get-config uipathctl command:./bin/uipathctl config orchestrator get-config --app-settings
{
  "key":"value"
}The uipathctl commands needed for configuring appSettings are:./bin/uipathctl config orchestrator get-config --app-settings- This exports the current configuration in a key-value pair json file, ready for editing. You can read more about it here../bin/uipathctl config orchestrator update-config --app-settings appsettings.json- This updates the configuration with your changes. You can read more about it here.

Export the current custom appSettings configuration to a json file using this command:./bin/uipathctl config orchestrator get-config --app-settings > appsettings.jsonEdit the exported appsettings.json file as needed. You can add, remove, or change any of its settings.Example:{
    "Triggers.DisableWhenFailedCount": "20",
    "Triggers.JobsCountStrategy": "NoLimit"
}You must export the file again every time you need to make a change, since the update overwrites all settings.Update the appSettings configuration using this command:./bin/uipathctl config orchestrator update-config --app-settings appsettings.json
