## Encrypting the SQL Server

To provide an additional layer of security to the data at rest in your SQL Server, you can use Transparent Data Encryption.

Transparent Data Encryption does not concern data in transit or in use. That means that if you run any queries on the database, retrieved information is unencrypted.

For details on how to encrypt your data using Transparent Data Encryption, see Microsoft documentation.


## Encrypting the connection to SQL Server

To ensure the security of data that is in transit between the UiPath® web application and the SQL Server database, you can configure an SSL encrypted connection between the two.

For details on how to enable an encrypted connection to the database engine using the SQL Server Configuration Manager, see Microsoft documentation.

For details on how to encrypt a connection on a cloud database using Azure SQL Database, see Microsoft documentation.
