# Support bundle log collection failure

# Description

When using an external OCI registry in an offline environment, the generated support bundle does not contain the historical logs and is not uploaded to the configured external object store. However, the current logs and configurations of the Kubernetes objects are included.

# Solution

To fix this issue, take the following steps on all nodes:

1. Add an additional mirror in the /etc/rancher/rke2/registries.yaml file, as shown in the folllowing example:mirrors: registry.uipath.com : endpoint: - <External OCI registry url>Replace <External OCI registry url> with your actual external OCI registry URL.
2. Restart the rke2-server or the rke2-agent after updating the registries.yaml file.
