# Update the underlying directory connections

Disabling or changing the AD integration settings does not update the underlying directory connections properly.

Run the following command to update the SQL DirectoryConnections table entries, then restart the Identity pods:

UPDATE [identity].[DirectoryConnections] SET IsDeleted = 1, DeletionTime=GETUTCDATE() WHERE (Type='ad' OR Type='ldapad') AND IsDeleted=0
