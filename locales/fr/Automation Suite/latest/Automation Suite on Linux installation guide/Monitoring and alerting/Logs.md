# Logs

Automation Suite logs typically serve as a resource for troubleshooting. If you cannot identify the root cause of an issue affecting your Automation Suite deployment, check for any active alerts and dashboards, then look for errors in logs.

Automation Suite container logs are collected and stored by FluentD.

Log forwarding is currently not supported. We are working on re-introducing support for it.
