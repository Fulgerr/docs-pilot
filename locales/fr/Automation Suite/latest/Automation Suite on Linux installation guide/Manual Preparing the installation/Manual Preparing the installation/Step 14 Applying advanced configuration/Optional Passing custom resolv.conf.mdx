# Optional: Passing custom resolv.conf

The Kubernetes cluster that Automation Suite deploys uses the name servers configured in /etc/resolv.conf. Kubernetes does not work with local DNS resolvers (127.0.0.1 or 127.0.0.0/8), so if you have such name servers configured in /etc/resolv.conf file, you need to pass a file reference with the correct nameserver entries accessible from anywhere on the VM in the .infra.custom_dns_resolver parameter in cluster_config.json.

For details on a known limitation, see Kubernetes documentation.


| Optional Parameters | Description |
| --- ---| .infra.custom_dns_resolver | Path to the file with correct name server entries that can be accessed from anywhere on the VM. These name server entries must not be from 127.0.0.0/8. |
