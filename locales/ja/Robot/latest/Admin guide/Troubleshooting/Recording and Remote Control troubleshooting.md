# Recording and Remote Control troubleshooting


## Minimized RDP window interference

RDP connection applications use different techniques to optimize resource consumption. One technique consists in disconnecting the remote display buffer when the RDP application is minimized. This may lead to issues with UI Automations, screen recording, or remote control. You can prevent these issues by disabling the resource consumption optimization.To achieve this, edit the Remote Desktop registry settings on all computers connecting to the Robot via RDP, but not on the Robot machine. You need administrator privileges to perform the following steps:

Close any active Remote Desktop sessions.Open the Registry Editor window.Navigate to the following Registry keys:For the current user:HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client (32 bit)HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client (64 bit)For all users on the machine: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client (32 bit)HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client (64 bit)For every key, create a new DWORD (32-bit) value, and rename it to "RemoteDesktop_SuppressWhenMinimized".Modify the previously created DWORD value: in the Value data field, write 2.Select OK to save the changes.Close the Registry Editor window.Sign off all users from the Robot machine before executing a job. You can now automate UI actions even when the RDP window is minimized.
