# Installing in a custom path

In the advanced settings of the Robot installation, you have the option to specify a
            custom installation path. This allows organizations to install the Robot in a specific
            location, according to their IT policies, rather than using the default path suggested
            by the installer. However, if the custom path is outside system-controlled folders such
            as Windows, Program Files, or Users, the system built-in security measures may not fully
            protect the installation. This can expose the software to unauthorized access or
            tampering.

We recommend using the system-recommended default path, which is designed to be secure.
            But if you need to install the Robot in a custom path, consider the following best
                practices:Restrict write permissions to trusted users, such as SYSTEM or Administrators
                    group members.Ensure regular users cannot modify files in the folder or gain access.
