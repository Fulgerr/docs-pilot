# Citrix Apps virtualization

Using Citrix Apps means that UiPath software, such as Robot or Assistant, is set up on a central server and then delivered to your device through the Citrix virtualization technology. This allows you to use Robot and Assistant on virtual machines and run attended automations in Citrix environments, without installing the UiPath software on your local machine.

When started through Citrix, both Assistant and Robot operate on the same virtual machine, and inherit the permissions of the logged-in Citrix user. You can manage Assistant and Robot from your local machine.

Any application the Robot uses must run on the same virtual machine, and you can see the corresponding interface on your computer.
