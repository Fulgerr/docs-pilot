# Connecting robots for attended automations to Orchestrator

To execute attended automations, you need to connect your robots to Orchestrator.

There are several ways to do that for User Mode robots:

* Using the Service URL, also known as Interactive Sign-In
* Using the client credentials in the Assistant
* Using the client credentials in the Command Line
