# Introduction to UiPath Robot

# What is the UiPath Robot

The UiPath Robot is a key component of the UiPath platform, designed to interact with different applications and systems, similar to a human user. It can execute complex workflows and process large amounts of data with speed and accuracy.

In the UiPath context, it is important to differentiate between a Robot and an automation. A Robot is the entity that performs task, whereas an automation is the programmed task performed by the Robot.

# Automation types

There are two types of automations:

* Attended automation, which is triggered by the user and usually requires human interaction, running on the user machine.
* Unattended automation, which is managed by Orchestrator and operates independently, often running in the background or during non-working hours, on a separate machine.

# UiPath Assistant

An important agent of attended automations is the UiPath Assistant. It provides a user-friendly interface that allows easy interaction between you and the Robot, so you can run automations directly from your desktop.

# Integration with UiPath Apps

The integration with UiPath Apps blurs the line between attended and unattended automations. With Apps, you can trigger unattended automations in an attended manner - you manually start the automation, but then the operation is executed independently, much like unattended automation.

# Key features

* Automated workflow execution: UiPath Robot can execute predefined automation workflows, performing tasks exactly as programmed, at high speed and zero errors.
* Attended and unattended automations: Able to work under human supervision (attended) or autonomously (unattended), driving flexibility and efficiency.
* Beyond traditional RPA - The capability to incorporate automation into your own applications. With UiPath Apps and Forms activities, you can build customized applications and create user-friendly forms within their automation workflows.
* Integration with UiPath Orchestrator: The ability to be managed remotely via the Orchestrator, enabling centralized deployment, logging, and auditing.
* Advanced scheduling capabilities: Robots can work around the clock and can be scheduled to run tasks at particular times via Orchestrator, optimizing resource utilization.
* Secure data handling: Security features prevent unauthorized access or leaks; sensitive data used in automation tasks is securely handled and maintained.
* Scalability: Robots can be easily extended or multiplied to match increasing workload or tackle new tasks, offering an easy route to scale up automation.
* Cross-functional capabilities: Robots can interact with various applications and software systems, from desktop to web and virtual environments.

# Security

When it comes to security, Robots do not store any sensitive information. This approach reduces the risk of data breaches.
