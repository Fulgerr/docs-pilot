# Compatibility matrix

The compatibility matrix in our Overview guide displays how Robot interacts with the standalone, Automation Suite, and cloud instances of Orchestrator.

## Robot & Standalone Orchestrator

# Untitled Section

- Compatible

- Not compatible

Studio and Robot always need to have the same version when installed on the same machine. For example, if you have Studio 2022.4.x installed, Robot must be 2022.4.x as well. It is usually recommended to first upgrade your Orchestrator and then your Robots. In this scenario, the Robots have to be reconnected to Orchestrator after the update.Automation projects created in Studio version 2021.10.6 and newer that have Windows and Cross-Platform compatibility cannot run on of robots older than 2021.10.6 because of the .NET version discrepancy.

## Robot, Studio & Orchestrator in Automation Cloud

We ensure backward compatibility with the three latest enterprise Robot and Studio releases. If you are currently using the third-latest Robot version, you should make arrangements to upgrade the Robot before we release the next Robot version, to avoid compatibility issues.Cloud Orchestrator ServiceRobot and Studio version 2024.10Robot and Studio version 2023.10Robot and Studio version 2023.4Robot and Studio version 2022.10


## Robot & Studio in Automation Cloud™ Public Sector

This matrix shows the support for compatibility between Automation Cloud Public Sector Orchestrator and the Robot, and Studio. Unless otherwise stated, patches are included.

We ensure backward compatibility with the three latest enterprise Robot and Studio releases. If you are currently using the third-latest Robot version, you should make arrangements to upgrade the Robot before we release the next Robot version, to avoid compatibility issues.

## Automation projects

Projects opened or created in a newer Studio version cannot be reliably opened with older Studio versions. This is due to internal changes, such as new frameworks versions and feature enhancements, which are incompatible with older Studio versions.If you need to maintain compatibility with a prior Studio version, avoid opening your project in the newer Studio version until your team and environment are fully upgraded. We strongly recommend using version control (for example, Git or UiPath Cloud) and creating backups before upgrading in order to revert if backward compatibility issues arise.

Projects created with alpha or beta Studio versions might not be compatible with newer Studio builds, nor can they be executed by newer Robots.

We support backward compatibility, except for breaking changes announced in the official release notes, and following the product lifecycle.

Newer Robots can execute projects created with older versions of Studio. For example, a project created with Studio 2023.4 should work on a 2024.10 Robot or newer.

We do not support forward compatibility. Projects compiled (published) with newer versions of Studio or the UiPath Command Line Interface (CLI) might not work with older Robots. For example, a project created in Studio 2024.10 might not work with a 2023.4 Robot.

The following table outlines how projects created or published in Studio work with Robot:
