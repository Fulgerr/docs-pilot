# Installing on Windows OS

UiPath provides two installers for Windows. You can download them from the Resource Center in UiPath Automation Cloud or from the Product Downloads section in Customer Portal.

# About 32-bit and 64-bit versions

* Before the 2021.4 release, Studio and Robot were 32-bit applications. However, from version 2021.4 onward, a 64-bit installer is the default.
* Starting with version 2023.4, a 32-bit installer is no longer provided, and the UiPathPlatformInstaller.exe is discontinued beginning with version 2021.4.
* To update existing 32-bit or 64-bit UiPathStudio.msi and UiPathPlatformInstaller.exe installations on 64-bit operating systems, use UiPathStudio.msi.
* The default installation path for pre-2021.4, 32-bit installation on a 64-bit system was C:\Program Files (x86)\UiPath\Studio. Upgrading to 64-bit installers migrates the installation to the C:\Program Files\UiPath\Studio folder. Installations that use custom paths do not change their directory after update.

# About quick and custom installations

You can perform the installation for the current user in a default configuration by selecting the Quick option in the installation wizard (no administrator privileges required) or configure the installation by selecting the Custom option (requires administrator privileges for per-machine installations).

If you are using Microsoft Windows Server, per-user installations may not be completed successfully. If an error occurs stating that policies have been set to prevent the installation, you can do one of the following if you are an administrator on the machine:Open the Registry Editor, and then, in the registry key HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer, configure the policy DisableMSI = 0 to enable the Windows installer for all applications.Perform the installation per machine by installing using the Custom option.The following table summarizes the differences and similarities between quick and custom installations.QuickCustomInstallation contextPer userPer user or per machineSupported robot installation typesUser modeUser mode for attended installations (per-user and per-machine).Service mode for unattended installations (per-machine).Administrator privileges required for the installationNoRequired only for per-machine installations.Installation directory%LocalAppData%\ProgramsA custom location can be selected.

### Using UiPathStudio.msi

UiPathStudio.msi is the Windows installer that targets mainly developers. When installed, the software package includes both the development environment (UiPath Studio), UiPath Robot, and UiPath Assistant to execute the developed workflows.

If you are looking to build, debug, and test automation on the same machine, use this installer.

# Available installation options

The default configuration includes:Studio, StudioX and AssistantRobot in User ModeStudioX Excel add-on (if you have Microsoft Excel already installed on your machine)Chrome extension (if you have Google Chrome already installed on your machine)Edge Chromium extension (if you have Microsoft Edge Chromium already installed on your machine)JavaScript Robot Add-onExtension for Microsoft Remote Desktop

* Custom installation - Allows you to select the components you want to install, and configure advanced settings. The installation path is %LocalAppData%\Programs for current user installations, and %ProgramFiles% for installations applicable to all users on the device.

# Custom installation - available options

### Using UiPathRobot.msi

UiPathRobot.msi is typically installed on Windows machines that mainly execute automations. No development environment is attached to this installation, and thus, resource allocation is primarily for running robots. It includes UiPath Robot and UiPath Assistant.

### Using the Command Prompt

Installing Robot or Studio using command line parameters is useful for installation on multiple machines, for silent installations, and for saving system resources that a graphical wizard might consume. It also allows customized installation settings and integration with scripts.

To install the Robot using the command prompt, you need administrator privileges.

# Best practices

* To escape the "%" character in system variable names, such as %username%, use the following command:^ - UiPathRobot.msi PACKAGES_FOLDER=C:\Some\Path\^%USERNAME^%In PowerShell, no escaping is needed.
* When using Active Directory domain accounts, specify the domain name in the folder structure:C:\packages\^%UserDomain^%.^%Username^%
* To use paths that contain spaces, use quotes:In Command Prompt, use double quotes:UiPathRobot.msi APPLICATIONFOLDER="C:\folder name"In PowerShell, use single and double quotes:./UiPathRobot.msi APPLICATIONFOLDER='"C:\folder name"'

### The live streaming feature

Starting with version 2024.10, the live streaming feature uses the RealVNC
                        software, which comes bundled in the UiPath Robot and UiPath Studio 2024.10+
                        installers. Installing or upgrading to the 2024.10+ Robot using the GUI or
                        the command prompt automatically installs RealVNC , unless the
                                ADDLOCAL parameter is used. If you choose to use
                        the ADDLOCAL parameter in a command prompt installation,
                        you must add the LiveStreaming flag.

For example, the following UiPathRobot.msi
                        command performs a custom installation or upgrade which also installs
                        RealVNC, the software that is required for live streaming:

UiPathRobot.msi ADDLOCAL=DesktopFeature,Robot,RegisterService,LiveStreaming
