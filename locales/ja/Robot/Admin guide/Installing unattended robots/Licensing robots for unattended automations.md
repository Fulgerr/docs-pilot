# Licensing robots for unattended automations


## Via Orchestrator

To license a robot for unattended automations, first upload and activate a license in Orchestrator, then connect the robot to that Orchestrator instance.To connect a robot to Orchestrator, you need to know the client credentials (client ID and secret) generated by the machine object in Orchestrator.In the Assistant, use the Client ID connection type, and provide the client credentials.In the Command Line Interface, use the--connect command, and provide the client credentials.


## Via Command Line (using the License Tool)

To license a robot without connecting it to Orchestrator, use the License Tool activate command in the Command Prompt. The license activation can be done offline and online.Check out the LicenseTool utility for more commands and parameters.
