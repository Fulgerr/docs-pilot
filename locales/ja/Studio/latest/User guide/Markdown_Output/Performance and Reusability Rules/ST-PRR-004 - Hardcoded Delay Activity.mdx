# ST-PRR-004 - Hardcoded Delay Activity

Rule ID: ST-PRR-004

Scope: Workflow

# Description

The rule checks whether The Delay Activity is overly used. This activity may affect performance, and thus its use should be limited.

# Recommendation

Consider using other mechanisms to wait for application states like use timeout/appear/exist instead of hardcoded delays. For more about synchronization, refer to the UI Automation page.
