# ST-PMG-002 - Identify Expressions that Are Incompatible with Windows Projects

Rule ID: ST-PMG-002

Scope: Workflow

# Description

The rule checks for expressions that are incompatible with Windows projects.

# Recommendation

Some expressions which are valid in Windows - Legacy projects are no longer accepted
                in Windows projects. For example, array initializers have to be strictly defined in
                Windows projects. Specifying the type of array should correct syntax errors.

Examples of expressions that are not valid in Windows projects include:

* {}
* {1, someVariable, new Object() {}}
* {1, someVariable}
