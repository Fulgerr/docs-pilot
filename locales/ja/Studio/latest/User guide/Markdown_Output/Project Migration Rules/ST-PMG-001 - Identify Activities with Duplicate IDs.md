# ST-PMG-001 - Identify Activities with Duplicate IDs

Rule ID: ST-PMG-001

Scope: Workflow

# Description

The rule checks whether all the activities used in the project have unique idRef
                values.

# Recommendation

Make sure all
            the activities used in the project have unique IDs. Performing any change inside an
            activity will regenerate the idRef and give it a unique value. Analyzing the project
            after changing the duplicate ID results in the rule no longer being triggered:
