# Debugging Actions

Debugging of a single file or the whole project can be performed both from the
                                Design or Debug ribbon tabs. However, the debugging
                        process is not available if project files have validation errors.

# Step Into

Use Step Into to debug activities one at a time. When this action
                                is triggered, the debugger opens and highlights the activity before
                                it is executed.

When Step Into is used with Invoke Workflow File
                                activities, the workflow is opened in a new tab in
                                        ReadOnly mode and each activity is executed
                                one by one.

The keyboard shortcut for Step Into is F11.

# Step Over

Unlike the Step Into action, Step Over does not open the
                                current container. When used, the action debugs the next activity,
                                highlighting containers (such as flowcharts, sequences, or Invoke
                                        Workflow File activities) without opening them.

This action comes in handy for skipping analysis of large containers
                                which are unlikely to trigger any issues during execution.

Step Over is available using the F10 keyboard shortcut.

# Step Out

As the name suggests, this action is used for stepping out and pausing
                                the execution at the level of the current container. Step Out
                                completes the execution of activities in the current container,
                                before pausing the debugging. This option works well with nested
                                sequences.

Step Out is available using the Shift + F11 keyboard
                                shortcut.

# Retry

Retry re-executes the previous activity, and throws the exception
                                if it's encountered again. The activity which threw the exception is
                                highlighted and details about the error are shown in the
                                        Locals and Call Stack panels.

# Ignore

The Ignore action can be used to ignore an encountered exception
                                and continue the execution from the next activity so that the rest
                                of the workflow can be debugged.

This action is useful when jumping over the activity that threw the
                                exception and continuing debugging the remaining part of the
                                project.

# Restart

Restart is available after an exception was thrown and the debug
                                process is paused. The action is used for restarting the debugging
                                process from the first activity of the project. Use Slow Step
                                to slow down the debugging speed and properly inspect activities as
                                they are executed.

Please take into consideration that when using this option after using
                                the Run from this Activity action, the debugging is restarted
                                from the previously indicated activity.

# Break

Break allows you to pause the debugging process at any given
                                moment. The activity which is being debugged remains highlighted
                                when paused. Once this happens, you can choose to Continue,
                                        Step Into, Step Over, or Stop the
                                debugging process.

It is recommended to use Break along with Slow Step so that
                                you know exactly when debugging needs to be paused.

An alternative to using Slow Step in this situation is to keep an
                                eye on the Output panel and use Break on the activity
                                that is currently being debugged.

# Focus

Focus Execution Point helps you return to the current breakpoint
                                or the activity that caused an error during debugging. The
                                        Focus button is used after navigating through the
                                process, as an easy way to return to the activity that caused the
                                error and resume the debugging process.

Alternatively, when debugging is paused because a breakpoint was reached,
                                        Focus can be used for returning to said breakpoint,
                                after navigating through activities contained in the automation
                                process.

A third case is when the debugging is paused either after using Step
                                        Into or Step Over and then navigating through the
                                process. In this case, Focus returns to the activity that
                                paused the debugging process.

From the Breakpoints context menu, you can select Focus to
                                highlight the activity with the breakpoint.

# Slow Step

Slow Step enables you to take a closer look at any activity during
                                debugging. While this action is enabled, activities are highlighted
                                in the debugging process. Moreover, containers such as flowcharts,
                                sequences, or Invoke Workflow File activities are opened.
                                This is similar to using Step Into, but without having to
                                pause the debugging process.

Slow Step can be activated both before or during the debugging
                                process. Activating the action does not pause debugging.

Although called Slow Step, the action comes with 4 different
                                speeds. The selected speed step runs the debugging process slower
                                than the previous one. For example, debugging with Slow Step
                                at 1x runs it the slowest, and fastest at 4x. In other words, the
                                speed dictates how fast the debugger jumps from one activity to the
                                next.

Each time you click Slow Step the speed changes by one step. You
                                can easily tell by the icon, which updates accordingly.

# Execution
                                Trail

The Execution Trail ribbon button is disabled by default. When
                                enabled, it shows the exact execution path at debugging. As the
                                process is executed, each activity is highlighted and marked in the
                                        Designer panel, showing you the execution as it
                                happens:

* executed activities are marked and highlighted in green;
* activities that were not executed are not marked in any way;
* activities that threw an exception are marked and highlighted in red.

# Highlight
                                Elements

If enabled, UI elements are highlighted during debugging. The option can
                                be used both with regular and step-by-step debugging.

# Log
                                Activities

If enabled, debugged activities are displayed as Trace logs in the
                                        Output panel. Note that Highlight Elements and
                                        Log Activities options can only be toggled before
                                debugging, and persist when reopening the automation project. This
                                is not applicable for invoked workflows unless these files are
                                opened in the Designer panel.

Logs are automatically sent to Orchestrator if connected, but you can
                                have them stored locally by disabling the Allow Development
                                        Logging option from the Robot
                                                Settings tab in the Add or Edit user
                                window.

Disabling Log Activities can be a way to send smaller log files to
                                Orchestrator.

When
                                running processes from Studio, the logs sent to Orchestrator are
                                always Trace when Log Activities is disabled, and
                                        Verbose when Log Activities is enabled.
                                This overrides both the Robot and the Orchestrator setting.

By default, the debugger logs activities so that each step appears in the
                                        Output panel. We recommend leaving it enabled for
                                easier tracing, as you can see in the image below:

![aeb5746-debug_log_activities_enabled=GUID-B49149F5-726A-45D7-A85E-D7260E76E74C=1=en=Default](/images/aeb5746-debug_log_activities_enabled=GUID-B49149F5-726A-45D7-A85E-D7260E76E74C=1=en=Default.gif)

The issue here is that one or more input fields from the User Input
                                sequence are blank, which is a True condition for the Flow Decision.
                                You can tell this by the fact that, during debugging, the User Input
                                sequence is executed twice, meaning that one or more fields were
                                left blank during the first execution.

If you decide to disable the Log Activities option for debugging,
                                Trace logs are not displayed in the Output panel. In the case
                                of a normal execution with no errors, you only get to see the debug
                                execution start and end times. However, adding a Log Message
                                can help you determine where issues might occur.

For example, you can add a Log Message activity to inform you
                                that, in this case, one or more input fields are empty. This message
                                appears in the Output panel during debugging, even if the
                                        Log Activities option is disabled, as you can see
                                below:

![c62ab21-debug_log_activities_disabled=GUID-B0189906-3745-4B33-8A43-697AE5D80ED7=1=en=Default](/images/c62ab21-debug_log_activities_disabled=GUID-B0189906-3745-4B33-8A43-697AE5D80ED7=1=en=Default.gif)

Remember that you can always filter the messages displayed in the Output panel
                                by simply selecting the alert types of interest, or even clear all
                                messages.

![3040f7d-filter_output_panel=GUID-A8A99A35-794F-40E4-823F-0861635887F6=1=en=Default](/images/3040f7d-filter_output_panel=GUID-A8A99A35-794F-40E4-823F-0861635887F6=1=en=Default.gif)

Note that by default all debugging logs are sent to Orchestrator. You can
                                disable this by clearing the Allow Development Logging option
                                from the Settings tab in the
                                Add or Edit Robot window. If this option is disabled, debugging logs
                                are only stored locally.

# Continue on
                                Exception

This debugging feature is disabled by default. When disabled in the
                                ribbon, it throws the execution error and stops the debugging,
                                highlights the activity which threw the exception, and logs the
                                exception in the Output panel. If a Global Exception
                                                Handler was previously set in the
                                project, the exception is passed on to the handler.

When enabled, the exception is logged in the Output panel, the
                                execution continues.

# Picture in
                                Picture

The Picture in Picture ribbon option in the Debug tab is
                                available for both executing and debugging processes or libraries in
                                a separate session on your machine.

If enabled, whenever you select Run or Run File,
                                        Debug or Debug File the process starts either
                                in a separate session or in a virtual desktop in the user session.
                                If Picture in Picture is disabled, debugging and execution is
                                performed in the current session.

Having the option to run a process in Picture in Picture (PiP) can be
                                very useful in attended automation. Verify whether a process runs
                                successfully in PiP, and then update the project settings to
                                indicate if it can be executed using this feature after it is
                                published:

1. In the Project panel, click Settings to open the Project Settings window.
2. In the General tab:PiP Options - Indicate whether the project was tested using Picture in Picture and whether it should start in PiP by default.Tested for PiP usage; Starting in PiP - The automation has been approved to run in PiP mode. When run, it starts in PiP by default. Tested for PiP usage; Not starting in PiP by default - The automation has been approved to run in PiP mode. When run, it starts in the main session or desktop by default. Not tested for PiP usage - The automation has not been approved to run in PiP mode. When run, it starts in the main session or desktop by default. If run in PiP, a dialog informs the user it was not tested using this feature and prompts for confirmation before proceeding. PiP Type - Select how to isolate the automation from the user session when running the project in PiP: New Session (child session on the machine) or New Desktop (virtual desktop in the user session).

# Remote
                                Debugging

When this feature is enabled, all run and debug operations are performed
                                on a specified remote robot instead of the robot installed locally,
                                allowing you to test the automation on different environments. For
                                more information, see Remote
