# ST-REL-001 - Mismatched argument types

Rule ID: ST-REL-001

Scope: Coded workflow

# Description

This rule ensures that the argument types of In/Out parameters are matching. For
                example, errors are highlighted when a DataTable is used as an
                output parameter for the Execute method, if the matching input
                parameter is a DataSet.

For instance, in the following code example, the same isConnected
                parameter is declared as bool, and then as an int.
                To resolve this, make sure the same type is used for the
                    isConnected parameter both as input and output.

public (bool IsConnected, string Name) Execute(int IsConnected, int32 Name)
        {
            return (true, "Jade");
        }

# Recommendation

We recommend to make sure that the data types for In/Out arguments always match. If
                the method returns a tuple, such as in public (bool IsConnected, string
                    Name) Execute(int IsConnected, int32 Name), an In/Out argument must
                still be declared both before and after the method. In this case,
                    IsConnected is the In/Out argument as it is declared twice.

On the other hand, when the method returns a single argument as in the example
                    public int Execute(int Output, int c), you can declare an
                In/Out argument by naming it Output. Naming any argument as
                    Output treats it as an In/Out argument, even if it's only
                declared once in the method.
