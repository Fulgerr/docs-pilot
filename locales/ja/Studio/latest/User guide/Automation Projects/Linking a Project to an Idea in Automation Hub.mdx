The integration between Studio and Automation Hub enables you to easily link Studio projects to ideas in Automation Hub:

* In Studio, you can link any project to an existing idea in Automation Hub by adding the idea URL in the project settings.
* In Automation Hub, for any idea that is in the Development phase and has the Not Started status, you can select to start development in Studio, which automatically opens your Studio instance and creates a new project that is linked to the idea.
