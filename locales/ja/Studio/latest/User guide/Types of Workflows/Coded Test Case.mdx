# Coded Test Case

Coded test cases automate and validate application behavior in a structured manner. They are similar to low-code test cases and allow for flexible automation using code.

When you create a coded test case, you define a Given-When-Then structure. This structure consists of three phases:Arrange - The arrange phase prepares the application.Act - The act phase performs specific actions.Assert - The assert phase verifies the expected results.

Coded test cases can also invoke other low-code workflows or test cases, allowing code reuse. This integration enables the creation of flexible test scenarios.

You can apply execution templates for Coded test cases, as well. Visit  to learn how to
            work with execution templates.
