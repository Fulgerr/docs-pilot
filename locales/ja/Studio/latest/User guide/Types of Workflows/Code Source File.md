# Code Source File

Coded source files serve as containers for custom classes or methods that you can use within Coded workflows or test cases. They are not entry points and cannot be executed independently; instead, they function within the context of a project.

# Structure

The structure of Coded Source Files is not predefined since they cannot run on their own. However, Studio automatically generates the namespace and file name based on the project name, ensuring a consistent structure throughout the project.

# Reusability

To use the code within a Coded Source File, simply invoke, define, or intialize the relevant classes or methods in your Coded Workflows or Test Cases. This allows you to leverage the custom logic defined in the Coded Source Files.
