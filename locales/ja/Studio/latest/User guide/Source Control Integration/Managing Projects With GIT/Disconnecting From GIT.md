# Disconnecting From GIT

The Disconnect option from Studio Backstage view > Team tab is available for versioned files in the following two cases:

1. A process is initialized as a local GIT repository. Create a new process, use GIT Init to add it to a local GIT repository and then use Disconnect to remove the subversion tag.
2. The subversion tag can be removed by clicking Disconnect for a GIT repository which includes parent and child projects.
3. If you disconnect a child project, then the entire GIT repository that contains the opened project is disconnected from source control. A message box is displayed in Studio requiring your confirmation before the disconnect action is performed.
