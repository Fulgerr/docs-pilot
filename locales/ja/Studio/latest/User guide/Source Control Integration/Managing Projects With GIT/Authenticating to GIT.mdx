# Authenticating to GIT

Authentication methods in Studio differ in accordance with the methods used for cloning a GIT repository, either HTTPS or SSH. Check this page to see which you should use if you're working with GitHub.

The GIT credentials you provide in Studio are
                    stored in Windows Credential Manager.The GIT integration with Studio currently supports two-factor authentication only for GitHub if you authenticate by signing in to the service. For other tools, use the SSO authentication method with a personal token, or the basic access authentication method.

The current guide details the steps for authenticating to a GitHub repository, but the Git integration in Studio is not limited to just this service.

### Over HTTPS

When cloning a remote GIT repository or copying the current project to an existing GIT repository using HTTPS for the first time, you must provide your GIT credentials.

You can authenticate using the following options:

* Credential Manager - Use credentials saved in Windows Credential Manager.
* Sign in with GitHub - Sign in with your GitHub account.
* User/Password - Enter your user and password.
* Token - Enter your user and personal access token. Follow the steps detailed in this page to generate a GIT token for your GitHub repository. The Sign in with GitHub option is available only for repositories hosted on github.com and requires the UiPath GitHub App to be installed in your organization or account.


### Over SSH

When cloning a repository or copying the current project to an existing GIT repository using
      SSH for the first time, you have the option of using either Windows Credential Manager or a
      private key:

Add the Private Key Path and the Password, and then click Open to clone
      your remote GIT repository. Check out the steps detailed here to generate a SSH key for
      your GitHub repository.


### Authentication Failed

# Over HTTPS

When cloning a GIT repository, the Enter Credentials window is displayed with the
        message Authentication failed if the provided credentials were incorrect:

![CloneGIT_EnterCredentials=GUID-4E0473AF-F26A-436C-BC93-9F11E4FE8F79=1=en=Default](/images/CloneGIT_EnterCredentials=GUID-4E0473AF-F26A-436C-BC93-9F11E4FE8F79=1=en=Default.png)

Enter the correct credentials and try again. You can also use Git Bash, for example, to
        clone your repository remotely and thus, check if the username and password are correct.

In the following image, we tried to clone a repository over HTTPS, but entered an incorrect
        password. The Git Bash window shows that the credentials were incorrect.

# Over SSH

The following Enter Credentials window is displayed when authentication fails over
        SSH:

![e45ae9c-private_key_fail=GUID-7ACD1404-EBC7-4076-A7EB-E9D674C19F3B=1=en=Default](/images/e45ae9c-private_key_fail=GUID-7ACD1404-EBC7-4076-A7EB-E9D674C19F3B=1=en=Default.png)

Enter the correct Private Key Path and Password and try again. You can also
        use Git Bash, for example, to clone your repository remotely and thus, check if the token
        and/or password are correct.

In the following image, we tried to clone a repository over SSH, but we didn't have any
        public SSH keys set up on our account.
