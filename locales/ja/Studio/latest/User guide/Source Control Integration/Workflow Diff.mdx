# Workflow Diff

Comparing changes between a process, library, project.json, or .txt file in a local repository and the latest version from GIT, TFS, or SVN is done using Workflow Diff in Studio. It shows a side-by-side comparison between the two files, highlighting added or removed activities, packages, variables, arguments.

When comparing changes between two .xaml files, Workflow Diff shows added or removed activities, variables, arguments, or modified activity properties. Default values for properties are not visible in the Show Changes window.

Workflow Diff is used for comparing changes made in the project.json file, such as adding, updating or removing dependencies, modifying the runtime rule, making workflows private, or setting a Global Exception Handler.

Workflow Diff must be used after the file is saved, and before it's checked into the source control repository.

# Comparing Workflow Versions

1. Check out a workflow or library from the GIT, TFS, or SVN repository, make modifications, and then save the file, but don’t check it in.
2. In the Project panel, right-click the .xaml file and click Show changes. The Workflow Diff window is displayed.

The Remote column on the left displays the .xaml structure for the file versioned under the GIT, TFS, or SVN repository, while the Local column on the right shows the file mapped locally.

The Modified Properties columns show the before and after states of activities properties, sequence display names and text boxes.

If the locally mapped .xaml file is corrupted, the Workflow Diff window is opened in the project.json/.txt view.

# Comparing Project.json Versions

1. Check out the project.json file in Studio and open the Manage Packages window to install, update, and remove dependencies. Click on Save to update the project.json.
2. In the Project panel, right-click the project.json file and click Show changes. The Workflow Diff window is displayed.

The Remote column on the left displays the project.json structure for the file versioned under the GIT, TFS, or SVN repository, while the Local column on the right shows the file mapped locally.

Dependency names are arranged alphabetically to aid with the comparing process between the two files.

# Viewing the File History

Aside from Workflow Diff, Show History from the same context menu allows you to compare changes between two versions of the same file. This option is available for GIT, TFS, and SVN versioned files, either .xaml or project.json.

1. Check out your project from source control in Studio. Make sure that the project has multiple commits.
2. In the Project panel, right-click the .xaml file and click Show History. The History window is displayed.
3. The History window displays the revisions made to the file, together with Commit messages, the author, and the date. Double-click a revision to open the Workflow Diff window and view changes between the selected file and the previous version.

The Details tab part of the History window displays the author, date, revision number, and commit message. The Changes tab reveals the files that were in during the selected commit. Double-click a file to open the Workflow Diff window and view changes between the selected file and the previous version.

Context Menu for Show History

Right-click a revision entry in the Show History window to open the context menu with options.
