# The Assign Activity

The Assign activity is an important activity that is going to be used quite often, as it enables you to assign a value to a variable.

You can use an Assign activity to increment the value of a variable in a loop (see the example in the The Do While Activity chapter), sum up the value of two or more variables and assign the result to another variable (see the example in the Generic Value Variables), assign values to an array (see Array Variables) and so on.

By default, this activity is also included in the Favorites group. To remove it, right-click it and select Remove.
