# Protecting Sensitive Information

To protect sensitive information that is logged during the execution of your automation at the Verbose level, you can choose not to log variable and argument values in both Orchestrator and Studio.

To do this, you can select the Private property check box from the activities that use sensitive information.

This property is currently not available in cross-platform projects and for some
          activities in Windows projects.The property only applies to default log messages. It does not apply when explicitly
          logging variable and argument values via activities such as Write Line or Log
            Message. To learn more, see Logging Levels.

This option is visible in the DisplayName of the activity:

This can also be achieved by using in the title of an activity, the reserved words from the excludedData parameter in the project.json file from a given project (%HOMEPATH%\Documents\UiPath\[PROJECT NAME]).

By default, only two words are reserved: "private" and “password.”

However, you can easily add custom reserved words, under the default ones, in between quotation marks. Please note that wildcards (*?) are supported.

In the example below, all the activities that have password in the name do not send logs to Orchestrator.
