# Assembly compilation errors

# NameDoesNotExistCSharpCompilationException

Exception:
                UiPath.ActivityCompiler.Exceptions.NameDoesNotExistCSharpCompilationException

Problem: You may encounter this exception when your Studio project, which
                includes coded automations (CS files), has a name containing expressions that are
                not supported. Common unsupported expressions include: Testing,
                    System, Portable, SAP,
                    UiPath, Driver, or other activity package
                names.

Solution: To remedy this issue, you can modify your project name to exclude
                unsupported expressions. If you want to keep the desired expression, consider
                separating these expressions with underscores. For example, if your project name is
                    My SAP Project (which includes SAP, an
                unsupported expression), consider using underscores to separate the words, making it
                    My_SAP_Project.
