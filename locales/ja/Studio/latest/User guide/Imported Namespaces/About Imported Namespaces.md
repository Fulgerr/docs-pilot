# About Imported Namespaces

In Studio, namespaces represent containers that store different types of data. They enable you to
            easily define the scope of your expressions, variables and arguments.

For example, if you have the System.Data namespace imported, you can further use DataTable, DataView, DataColumn, DataRow and other classes that are available in it, without having to always type System.Data.DataTable and so on.

You can view and manage namespaces from the Data Manager or from the Imports panel. Note that some namespaces are automatically imported when you browse for a .Net type variable or argument.
