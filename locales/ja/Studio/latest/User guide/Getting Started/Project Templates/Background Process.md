# Background Process

The Background Process is a template for creating processes that can run in
            parallel on the same Robot, together with one foreground process. For this reason,
            background processes must not contain activities that require user interaction.

The default dependencies of a background process template are: UiPath.Excel.Activities,
                UiPath.Mail.Activities,
                UiPath.System.Activities, and UiPath.WebAPI.Activities.

Background processes must not make use of interactive activities, like Click or Type Into found in the UiPath.UIAutomation.Activities package. Check out the Background Process
                Automation page to read more about how the Robot handles such
            processes.

In Studio, go to the Home Backstage view and select Background Process. The New
                Background Process window opens. Click Create after filling in the
            fields.

A process may be turned into a Background Process as long as it does not contain
            activities with UI interaction. Go to the Project Settings window and set the
                Starts in Background toggle to Yes.

Consequently, a Background Process may be turned into a foreground one by
            switching the same toggle to No.

Before publishing a background process, make sure it does not contain any interactive
            activities. Using such activities in background processes, while running at the same
            time with foreground processes may cause unexpected results.

Please note that a Background Process runs in Session 0 when started from
            Orchestrator on an Unattended Robot.

                Automation page, which provides more information on this subject.
