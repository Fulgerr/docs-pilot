# AI-generated test data

You can generate test data that is highly specific for your testing needs, using the
            AI-powered capabilities offered by AutopilotTM.
            Initially, Autopilot lets you input specific instructions, after which it produces
            arguments and variables that are relevant to both the instruction and the associated
            test data set. Additionally, you can instruct Autopilot to generate new arguments for
            your test data set that are later added to your test case.

# Prerequisites

For Autopilot to generate test data, your test case must contain arguments of the
                types that we currently support. Check the Supported argument types section
                for the list of argument types that you can include in your test cases.

# Supported argument types

The supported argument types for AI-generated test data are:

* String
* Int32, Int64
* Double
* Decimal
* Boolean
* Char
* Byte
* SByte
* UInt16, UInt32, UInt64
* Single

                cases

To generate test data with Autopilot for a low-code or coded test case:

1. Open the Test Explorer.
2. Right-select the test case for which you want to generate test data, and select Add Test Data.
3. From the Source dropdown list, select Generate with Autopilot.
4. Enter instructions in the Write down your prompt text field to generate a first round of test data.
5. As an optional step, you can enhance the generated test data with additional prompt instructions.If instructed, Autopilot adds more arguments than the current ones. The additional arguments are then added to the test case. Additionally, you can instruct Autopilot to generate a certain number of data variations.
6. When you are satisfied with the generated test data, select Import to add the data to your test case.
