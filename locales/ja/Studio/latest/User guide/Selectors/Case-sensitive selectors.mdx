# Case-sensitive selectors

# About case-sensitive selectors

When a selector is built, the case-sensitive property makes it possible to identify elements by
                also taking into consideration the casing of an attribute's value.

You can use case-sensitive along with RegEx on the same attribute.

# How case-sensitive selectors work

To enable identification of attributes by casing, the case-sensitive() attribute
                needs to be included in the selector, in the tag of the target attribute:

OptionDescriptioncasesensitive:<attribute-name>='true'Enables you to validate a selector by also including an attribute's value casing. By default, the value of this option is set to true. If set to false, the casing of the attribute's value is not taken into account.
