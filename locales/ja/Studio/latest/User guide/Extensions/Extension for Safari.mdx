# Extension for Safari

Starting with UiPath.UIAutomation.Activities version 24.10.0, Safari UI Automation support is available in preview. The extension for Safari allows you to:

* Design UI automations in Studio Web within the Safari browser on macOS.
* Execute browser automations in Safari using a local macOS Robot, previously installed and connected to the Orchestrator.
* Start attended browser automations in Safari via the macOS Assistant.

To create and run such automations, you must install the UiPath® extension for Safari.

You can start from Studio Web by adding any UI Automation activities. When accessing Studio Web from Safari, you are prompted to install the UiPath extension for Safari from the App Store. Follow the setup guide to configure the extension, then start designing your workflows for browser automation in Safari.

To create browser automations in Safari on machines running macOS, the minimum supported version is macOS 12.
