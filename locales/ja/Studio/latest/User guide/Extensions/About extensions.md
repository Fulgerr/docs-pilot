# About extensions

UiPath extensions help you broaden your automation capabilities to web browsers, Java
            applications, Silverlight applications, and Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops, as well as
            over RDP connections, and more. They enable native detection of UI elements in such
            environments, so that selectors are properly built. The UiPath extensions can be
            installed from Studio or the Command Prompt.

You can install extensions from the Command Prompt using the SetupExtensions tool, located in the C:\Program
                Files\UiPath\Studio\UiPath folder for per-machine installations, or the
                %localappdata%\Programs\UiPath\Studio\UiPath folder for per-user
            installations. Administrator rights are required to install extensions from the Command
            Prompt.
