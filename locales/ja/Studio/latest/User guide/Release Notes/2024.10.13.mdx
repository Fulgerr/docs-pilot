# 2024.10.13

Release date: 4 June 2025

# Improvements

* You can now control what activities are hidden in the Activities panel through a governance policy.
* We removed the messages about phasing out the creation of new Windows-Legacy projects.

# Bug fixes

* Updating dependency packages with the Project Dependencies Mass Update Tool did not work as expected when using the Strict runtime rule.
* Variable names containing Japanese characters were unexpectedly renamed when migrating some Windows-Legacy projects to the Windows compatibility.
* The Open Workflow button in the Invoke Workflow File activity did not work as expected in some projects.
* A Folder does not exist or the user does not have access to the folder error occurred when remote debugging some projects if Studio and the remote machine were connected to different tenants and both tenants contained a folder with the same name.
* A System.IO.FileNotFoundException: Could not load file or assembly 'System.Activities.Presentation.Common, Version=6.0.0.0 error occurred when using the command-line user interface to analyze some Windows-Legacy projects.
* Debugging a coded workflow with variables implementing the IGrouping interface (System.Linq) used to throw an exception. As a result of this fix, the values of IGrouping variables are not displayed in the Locals panel during debugging.
