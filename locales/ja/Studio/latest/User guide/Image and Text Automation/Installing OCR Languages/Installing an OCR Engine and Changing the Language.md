# Installing an OCR Engine and Changing the Language


### Microsoft OCR

# Windows 10

To add a language to your system and then use it in your workflow:

1. Go to Start Menu > Settings, the Windows Settings window opens. Make sure to maximize the window.
2. Access Time & Language, the Date & time window opens.
3. On the left side menu, select Region & language. Under Languages, click Add a language.
4. Choose your preferred language and click Next. The Install language features window opens.
5. Uncheck the Set as my Windows display language check box. Click Install and wait for the installation to finish.
6. Restart UiPath Studio for new languages to become available. The language can now be used in Studio by adding its name between quotation marks (“Japanese”).If a language is simply added and not installed it cannot be used by the Microsoft OCR engine. Not all system languages are supported.

# Windows 7 and Windows 8.1

The Microsoft OCR engine needs to be manually installed.

1. Download and install Microsoft SharePoint Designer 2010 32-bit or 64-bit.
2. Choose your Office version and language here, and follow the instructions to set up the desired language.


### Tesseract OCR

1. Search for the desired language file on this page .
2. Save the file in the tessdata folder of the UiPath installation directory
                        (C:\Program Files\UiPath\Studio\tessdata).
3. Restart UiPath Studio for the new languages to become available. The language can now be used in Studio by adding its name between quotation marks (“ron”).


### ABBYY OCR

ABBYY FineReader Engine SDK is required. The engine only works with a license distributed by the UiPath sales department.

1. Contact our sales department to obtain a functional ABBYY FineReader Engine SDK License. Access the Contact us page.
Go to Technical Support & Activations.
Request a license by filling up the form.
Choose “Service Request” after providing a Name and Email.
2. Press Win + S to open up Search.
3. Type CMD and then press Ctrl + Shift + Enter . This opens Command Prompt with Administrator Privileges.
4. Navigate to the download directory. Use cd.. to go up one folder and cd folder_name to access a specific folder in Command Prompt.
5. Type Setup.exe /qb /v INSTALLDIR="C:\Abbyy\FR11" SN=serialkey ARCH=x86 LICENSESRV=Yes. The /qb and /v switches handle the interface and caching options.
INSTALLDIR is the installation path.
SN is the serial number obtained at step 1.
ARCH represents the installation architecture which needs to match that of UiPath Studio.
6. Navigate to the Bin folder in the installation directory. It should look something like C:\abbyy\fr11\Bin .
7. Type LicenseManager.exe /SilentActivation /SN:serialkey to activate the license key. The /SilentActivation switch disables user prompts.
SN is the serial number obtained at step 1.
8. Restart UiPath Studio to use ABBYY OCR.
