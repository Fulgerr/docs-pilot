# Working with Coded automations

This page provides instructions on debugging, running, and publishing your coded automations.

# Debugging

Debugging coded automations resembles the debugging process for low-code automations.
                You can set breakpoints, utilize debugging panels, and enable profile execution.
                Also, the debug running mode stops on each affected line, so you can troubleshoot.
                Visit  to
                learn more about debugging automations in Studio.

You can't perform remote debugging on coded
                automations.

# Running

You can run coded automations similarly to how you would run a low-code automation.
                In the Design tab in Studio, click Run to run the whole project, or
                    Run File to run the current file.

                in Studio.

# Validation

You can run the Workflow Analyzer to check your project for inconsistencies
                unrelated to project execution. This ensures that your project meets high quality
                and reliability standards. After you run the Workflow Analyzer, in the
                    Error List panel you can see compilation messages and errors. The panel
                shows validation errors, warnings, and messages specific to both XAML (low-code
                automations) and CS files (coded automations).In
                    comparison to low-code automations, you are unable to manage the rules that
                    govern the analysis process.

# Publishing

To publish a Studio project, you can select the Publish option in the
                    Design tab ribbon. By default, all files in the project folder are
                published except for test cases.

You can prevent a specific file from being included in the published package by
                right-clicking it in the Project panel and selecting Ignore from
                    Publish. Otherwise, right-click a file in the Project panel and
                select Set as publishable.

Projects can be published to Orchestrator, a custom NuGet feed, or locally. After
                publishing to Orchestrator, the archived project is displayed on the Packages
                page, and you can create a process to be distributed to Robots. To publish a
                project, the project.json and design.json files in
                the project folder must not be in a read-only location.When you publish a project that contains coded automations, an XML
                    file is generated for any custom code or libraries. This XML documentation file
                    is included both in the project folder, and in the lib
                    subfolder of the generated NUPKG file.

# Supported runtimes

Coded automations support the following runtimes:

* Robot - You can deploy coded automations on Robots that support the Windows framework versions 2022.4 and higher.
* Orchestrator - You can deploy coded automations on any version of Orchestrator that's in support.

# Converting coded automations

You can convert a coded workflow to a coded test case and the other way around. To
                convert a coded automation, right-click the file in the Project panel and
                select Convert to Test Case or Convert to Workflow.

# Coded automations and UiPath CLI

For projects that contain coded automations and run using UiPath CLI version 2023.10,
                you must to commit the CodedWorkflow.cs file located in your local
                project file using the GIT integration. Follow the path structure 
                    .local/install/CodedWorkflow.cs for the files you need to commit.
