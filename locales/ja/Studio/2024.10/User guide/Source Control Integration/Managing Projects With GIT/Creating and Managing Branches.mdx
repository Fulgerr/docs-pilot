The Rebase option rebases the current branch onto the selected branch.
The Merge option merges the selected branch into the current branch.To merge a branch into the master of a GIT remote repository, you need to have the master branch checked out in Studio and then merge the modified branch into master.
* To switch between branches, open the branch menu in the status bar, and then
                select the branch to switch to from the list of recently checked out branches.

Branches need to be added locally in Studio from the Manage
                Branches window. Adding branches from the remote GIT repository may cause issues
            when trying to switch between branches.
