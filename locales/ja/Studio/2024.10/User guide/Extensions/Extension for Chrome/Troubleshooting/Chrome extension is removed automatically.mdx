# Chrome extension is removed automatically

# Description

If the extension works for a while after installation, but is removed and needs to be
                reinstalled, the most likely cause is a Group Policy update.

After installing the browser extension using Group Policy, the necessary Group
                Policies are automatically registered on your machine and the UiPath extension for
                Chrome is installed and automatically enabled.

But if your organization uses Group Policies to manage browser extensions, when the
                Group Policy is applied periodically, the information corresponding to the UiPath
                extension may be overwritten.

In this case, the installed extension must be added to the organization’s Group
                Policy after the browser extension was installed from Studio using Group Policy.

# Solution

You must contact your organization’s administrator to add the necessary Group
                Policies to your organization’s Group Policy, as described in the Install from Group Policy section. More
                details can be found in the Chrome Enterprise policy list page.
