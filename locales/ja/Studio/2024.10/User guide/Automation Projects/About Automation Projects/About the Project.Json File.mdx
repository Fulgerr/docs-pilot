# About the Project.Json File

Project.json is an automatically generated file which is created for each
        .xaml file marked as Main in the project folder.

The file holds varied information, including project dependencies, or web services loaded in
      libraries. For more information about web services in libraries, check out the Loading Web Services in Libraries page.

Manually editing the
            project.json file should be attempted for troubleshooting scenarios
          only, as it may lead to severe consequences and loss of support.As of 2018.2,
        you should specify a project.json file when running your project from the
        UiRobot.exe (command line) client.

The parameters contained in the Project.json file are described in the
      following table.


| Parameter | Description |
| --- ---| name | The title of the automation project. It is provided in Studio                 when creating a new process or library. |
| description | The description of the project. It is provided in the Description                 field in Studio when a new project is created. |
| main | The entry point of the automation project. It consists of an                   .xaml file. The default name is “Main.xaml”. It is displayed both                 as the title of the Designer panel and in the Properties panel in                 Studio. If you want to execute a different project first, change the value of this                 parameter to the name of the .xaml file to be processed.If your automation                 project contains multiple files, each of them should be linked to the                   Main.xaml file through the Invoke Workflow File                 activity. This is especially useful when the project is published to Orchestrator                 and sent to a Robot, as the Robot executes only the file provided in this                 parameter. |
| dependencies | The activities packages used to create the automation project and                 their versions. The list is updated every time a dependency is added or removed from                 the project, or when a package version changes.Version numbers are                 composed of the following parts, in order: major, minor, build, and revision. The                 build value is the number of days that elapsed since 01.01.2000. The revision value                 is the number of seconds which elapsed on the day of the release, starting from 5                 AM, GMT. |
