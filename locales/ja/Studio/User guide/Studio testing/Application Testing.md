# Application Testing

Application testing requires working with large data sets to verify workflow execution and cover
            corner cases. Through data-driven testing, you can run the same test using different
            data variations within a single test case. For more information on performing
            application testing, visit Getting started with Test Suite. .

For application testing projects you can use the following activity packages:

* UiPath.System.Activities
* UiPath.UIAutomation.Activities
* UiPath.Testing.Activities

If you encounter an error for the activities of type Verify, from the Testing.Activities package,
            the execution logs the failed activity in the Output panel as opposed to stopping the
            workflow from running.
