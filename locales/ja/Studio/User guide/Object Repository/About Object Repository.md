# About Object Repository

The Object Repository ensures the management, reusability, and reliability of UI
      elements by capturing them as objects in a DOM-like repository, sharable across projects. It
      allows for creating and reusing UI taxonomies inside and across automation projects. With
      Object Repository you can build a UI API for your application and share it with your team
      within minutes.

The key features of the Object Repository are:

* UI elements across the project are managed,
        updated, and modified from a centralized place.
* View a list of all your UI activities
        inside your process by using the UI Activities tab inside Object Repository panel.
* Quickly capture elements you need in your
        automation with the Capture Elements wizard.
* increased selector reliability with the
        help of the Capture Elements recorder that captures elements, together with their
        anchors.
* With the help of anchors, objects keep
        their reliability in case the application received a slightly new UI.
* Drag-and-drop elements from the Object
          Repository panel.
* Objects are reusable in local project or
        across projects when packaged as libraries.
* Upgrade application and process UI
          elements in one go with UI libraries. The Object Repository
              might not work as expected if projects are under a file management system (for example,
              OneDrive).

# Prerequisites

The

Object
        Repository

works with

UiPath.UIAutomation.Activities

package versions 20.10.x and above.

![ObjectRepository_2024.10Capture=GUID-902B357A-CE72-44B0-A0D4-80441C5F26DA=1=en=Default](/images/ObjectRepository_2024.10Capture=GUID-902B357A-CE72-44B0-A0D4-80441C5F26DA=1=en=Default.png)

When the Object Repository enforced toggle is set to Yes, activities
        part of the UIAutomation pack need to reference elements from the Object
        Repository.

The classic UI Automation activities are hidden by default. However, they
        are still available under the Classic category in the Activities panel and can
        be added to a project from the Activities panel or the Add activity search
      bar.

# Key concepts

UI
        descriptors

A UI descriptor is a superset of selectors. It holds information for
        uniquely identifying elements on the screen.

UI descriptors are extracted from
        activities in the workflow and added to a structured schema that groups them by
        applications, application versions, screens, and UI elements. Out of this taxonomy
        structure, only screens and elements hold descriptor information. The rest are used for
        grouping and their role is to ensure upgrades between versions of an application.

UI
        descriptors can be part of:

* One project for wide reuse.
* Snippets repositories for testing purposes.
* UI libraries for global cross-project sharing.

UI elements

UI elements contain full or partial element
        selectors, anchor selectors, screen and element image capture context, and other metadata
        that describes the element on the screen.

Screens

Screens are
        UI scopes that are either extracted from activities inside the workflow or are generated at
        element capture time. A screen groups together multiple elements belonging to the same
        screen.

UI applications

A UI application is a targeted
        application that can have multiple versions and each version can have multiple screens.
        Applications can be of multiple types:

* Desktop/Web application
* Mobile application

For defining mobile applications, you need to use UiPath.MobileAutomation.Activities
        package.

The structure of UI libraries created with the Object Browser has the
        following hierarchy: Application > Version > Screen > UI
          Element.

UI libraries

A UI library is an encapsulation of
        elements grouped by applications, application versions, and screens. Elements you define can
        be extracted as a UI library, and after publishing can be installed in other projects as a
        dependency.

A UI library may contain several applications but can contain only one
        version of a certain application. This mechanism ensures that when you upgrade a dependency,
        you also upgrade the application version you were using inside your projects.

When
        creating a new version of an existing application, you need to reuse the existing elements.
        Elements have unique identifiers that are used when referenced from activities. You can
        always change the contents of an element (descriptors and other metadata).

# Reusability

The Object
          Repository enables you to reuse your UI elements across projects:

* All locally stored elements can be reused at project level.
* For testing purposes, you can use Snippets panel to save into and pass applications between projects. From Snippets you can add applications to your local project repository.
* Extract elements into UI libraries and install them as a dependency into your projects when you want to reuse at a global level. You can also take a reusability-first approach and start by creating UI libraries with the elements you will need across all your automation projects.

# Object Repository structure

The
        object repository has a tree structure where each node is an object representing screens or
        elements, all hierarchical under the application. The structure is the following:

* Application - it can be one of two types: mobile or desktop/web, depending on what technology is used for UI Automation.
* Version - applications can have multiple versions.
* Screen - top-level window of an application version that can only be created under an app version.
* UI element - an object on the screen with a descriptor and metadata. It can be of multiple types.

UI elements can be freely rearranged in the tree structure, as long as they remain
        under their designated screen. To move, simply drag and drop the element to the desired
        location inside the tree.

Elements can also be part of other elements and they can
        also be grouped under containers with no UI specific role. This allows defining a UI
        structure that is as close as possible to what the user sees on screen.
