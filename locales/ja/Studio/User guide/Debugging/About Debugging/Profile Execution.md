# Profile Execution

# Overview

Profile Execution helps you spot performance
                                                  bottlenecks during workflow executions rather than
                                                  tracking the overall execution time. As you run or
                                                  debug a workflow, it provides an analysis of each
                                                  operation's performance, reflecting a cumulative
                                                  percentage of every activity's execution time.

# How
                                                  it works

Profile execution involves execution duration,
                                                  which is the time from the start of a workflow's
                                                  first activity to the end of the last activity.
                                                  For example, if your file contains a top level
                                                  Sequence, it displays the total time taken for all
                                                  the Sequence's activities to run.

When no workflow file is selected, the total
                                                  duration displayed is the cumulative sum of all
                                                  top-level durations, excluding Invoke
                                                  Workflow activities.

Suppose you execute several test cases or regular
                                                  workflow files that invoke the same file. The
                                                  total duration might not match the actual
                                                  execution time. However, the tool groups together
                                                  the execution times from multiple runs of the
                                                  invoked file. This grouping helps you spot
                                                  occasional performance issues and generates run
                                                  statistics. The primary purpose of profile
                                                  execution is to identify activities that create
                                                  delays in workflow execution.

# Considerations

* Profiling data generated during debugging might be different from data generated during production (running the file).
* The data is stored for each session in C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\UiPath\ProfiledRuns (see Import previous profiling sessions).

# Analyzing profiling results

To profile an execution, run a file or debug the
                                                  file, then go to the Debug ribbon tab.

Make sure that your automation works correctly
                                                  without slow performing workflows. If you identify
                                                  potential flow issues, you can review workflows
                                                  that take longer to be completed. Use the
                                                  context menu for profiling to take
                                                  actions.

The Execution Details at the bottom of the
                                                  Profiling tab shows the number of
                                                  executions and descriptive statistics such as the
                                                  average duration and the minimum and maximum
                                                  duration values.

# Import profiling session

You can import profiling sessions to examine
                                                  previous runs. Focus is disabled on imported
                                                  profiling sessions.
