# Automatic Recording

Automatic recording is very useful and time-saving as it can provide you with a skeleton for your business processes, and can be easily customized and parameterized.

# Auto-implemented activities or coded
        automation APIs

As shown in the following examples, recordable actions are directly mapped to existing activities
        or coded automation APIs and automatically implemented into your workflow:

* Click/ Click coded automation API – implemented when you select a button (Basic and Desktop) or a link (Web). The options available in the Properties panel, or within the overloads, enable you to add a time delay before or after the action, change the click type and add key modifiers.
* Type Into/ TypeInto coded automation API – implemented when typing into a text field or any editable UI element. The options available in the Properties panel, or within the overloads, enable you to add a time delay before or after the action or between key strokes, change the text at any point, and erase the entire field before writing to it (EmptyField).
* Select Item/ SelectItem coded automation API - implemented when you select an item from a drop-down list or combo box. The options available in the Properties panel, or within the overloads, enable you to add a time delay before or after the action, and change the selected item.
* Check/ Check coded automation API - implemented when a radio button or check box is clicked. The options available in the Properties panel, or within the overloads, enable you to add a time delay before or after the action, and select or unselect the check box.

# The Active UI Framework

While recording, the Active UI Framework can be changed, for different results in the detection of different application UI Elements.

The following options are available:Default - This is the UiPath proprietary method. Usually works fine with all types of user interfaces.Active Accessibility - This is an earlier solution from Microsoft for making apps accessible. It is recommended that you use this option with legacy software, when the Default one does not work.UI Automation - This is the improved accessibility model from Microsoft. It is recommended that you use this option with newer apps, when the Default one does not work.

While recording, the Active UI Framework can be switched by using the F4 shortcut key.
