## The Ribbon




### Ribbon Display Options

You can configure the ribbon to increase or decrease the space available for the
                Designer panel by clicking:

Compact View to get a streamlined view of the ribbon.Standard View to see the full size of the ribbon.

You can also show or hide the ribbon by clicking:Pin the ribbon to always show the ribbon.Unpin the ribbon to only show the ribbon tabs. You can also right-click a
                    pinned ribbon and select Collapse the Ribbon.


### Ribbon Tabs

The ribbon consists of the following three tabs:

* Home - create and open projects,
        configure Studio, or access help and license information from the Studio Backstage
            View .
* Design - add sequences,
          flowcharts and state machines to your project, install and manage activities packages,
          build interactions with UI elements, export workflows to Excel, and then publish your work
          to Orchestrator or custom feeds. Keep in mind that wizards and UI Explorer aren't
          visible in the Ribbon unless you install the
            UiPath.UIAutomation.Activities package.
* Debug - debug your workflow,
          while using debugging tools to set breakpoints, monitor the execution of activities step
          by step, and adjust the debugging speed. Open logs to view details regarding execution and
          any changes made to the project. For more information on debugging, check the About Debugging page. Files that are not created
          during the execution of the automation project become read-only when published to Orchestrator. If your business process requires
          you to write in a specific file at some point, be sure to create it while designing the
          project.

![ced16bb-help_icon=GUID-12F13262-A0E2-48B2-94FC-5C0430B2538C=1=en=Default](/images/ced16bb-help_icon=GUID-12F13262-A0E2-48B2-94FC-5C0430B2538C=1=en=Default.png)


## Backstage View

This is the view you see when you first open Studio. You can also get here by clicking
        Home in the upper-left corner of the window. Here you can create and open projects,
      configure Studio, or access help and license information.

![TheUserInterface_BackstageView3=GUID-1C232F39-73BB-4FB0-BA5A-6A05A6826777=1=en=Default](/images/TheUserInterface_BackstageView3=GUID-1C232F39-73BB-4FB0-BA5A-6A05A6826777=1=en=Default.png)

The following buttons and tabs are available in this view:

* Open - Browse to a local
          automation project and open it. By default, projects are created in
          C:\Users\<current_user>\Documents\UiPath. Projects located on network
          folders where your user only has read permissions cannot be opened in Studio. We recommend
          using source control systems to collaborate on
          projects.
* Close - Close the automation project
        that is currently open.
* Start - Create a new automation
        project or open recently accessed projects. You can create a new project from predefined
        templates or open a project you recently worked on. Projects can be pinned or removed from
        the Open Recent list, which displays the description, target framework, language used for
        expressions, and project source (local, Studio Web, or GIT/SVN/TFS repository) for each
        project. Hovering over an entry in the Open Recent list displays the path to the project.json file and when the project was last opened.
* Templates - Create a new project
        based on a template. In this tab, you can view all available project templates, search and
        filter them by source. For more information, see Project
            Templates .
* Team - Manage source
            control integration for the automation project.
* Tools - Access tools that enhance
          your experience with Studio. Select the Apps tab for the
              UI Explorer, Project Dependencies Mass Update Tool, and the Repair
                Tool for Microsoft Office. Select the UiPath Extensions tab
            to install or uninstall the following extensions: Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Java, Silverlight, Citrix, Windows
            Remote Desktop, VMware Horizon, Excel Add-in, and SAP Solution Manager. Select the Plugins tab to enable
            or disable source control and test
                automation plugins.
* Settings - Change the look and feel
        of Studio, set global preferences, and manage activities package sources. For more
        information, see Configuring Studio Settings .
* Help - Directs you to product
          documentation, release notes, online resources, the Community Forum and the RPA Academy. This is where you can also access a quick tutorial that helps you learn the basics of
          creating, publishing, and running an automation. To ensure the tutorial is
          completed successfully, we recommend that you pause the tutorial before making any changes
          to the workflow outside of those highlighted in the tutorial steps. Information regarding product version and installation, license availability, and device
          ID is also found in the Help tab, together with a Copy Info button for
          quickly copying the details to the clipboard.


## The Command Palette

The Command Palette is opened by using the Ctrl + Shift + P, F3 keyboard
      shortcuts, or by clicking the search button. It incorporates the Add activity, the
        Universal search, the Go to file, and Jump to activity search bars, as
      well as the Navigate forward and Navigate backward file navigation options.

![dc90c06-command=GUID-6E8BF94C-5A31-49FB-A49E-42B027E20EE8=1=en=Default](/images/dc90c06-command=GUID-6E8BF94C-5A31-49FB-A49E-42B027E20EE8=1=en=Default.gif)

Studio supports prioritizing activities by scope. Click the  icon inside an activity scope and notice that the Command Palette offers suggestions of activities which fit the current scope. Support for this feature is rolling out in stages in official activities packages, check release notes periodically.


### Add Activity

The Add activity search bar is opened using the Ctrl + Shift + T keyboard
      shortcut. You can search for activities in installed and installable packages, and add them
      after the selected activity in the file. The bar automatically assigns keyboard shortcuts to
      the first five results, and remembers your previous findings.

![AddActivitySearchBar2=GUID-09DB9280-BDD4-4A73-9AE1-3CC86BF5AC98=1=en=Default](/images/AddActivitySearchBar2=GUID-09DB9280-BDD4-4A73-9AE1-3CC86BF5AC98=1=en=Default.png)

Click the  icon at the top or bottom of an activity from a
      sequence to open the Add activity search bar.

If the Enable AI activity suggestions option in the Studio
      design settings is selected, a UiPath AI service analyzes the location in the workflow where
      you opened the Add activity search bar and suggests activities that you may want to add next
      based on the current context. If there is no context (for example, you press Ctrl + Shift +
        T when no activity is selected in the Designer panel) activity suggestions are not
      provided.

If the Show activities
        available to install option in the Studio design settings is selected, you can search
      for activities that are not included in your installed packages. Searching for available
      activities is only possible for packages from the Official and Orchestrator
        Tenant feeds. Adding an available activity also installs its corresponding activity
      package. Selecting the installation  button
      installs the package without adding the activity to the workflow.

# Generate
        workflows with Autopilot™

With Autopilot™ generative capabilities, you can use
        natural language to describe the structure and outcome of a workflow. To automatically
        generate a workflow, simply type in the search bar what your workflow should do and
        double-click the Generate with Autopilot option. Autopilot will then analyze your
        instructions, identify relevant activities, and add them in a logical sequence. If the
        instructions are not valid, you are asked to try a different description.

After
      processing your instructions, a preview of the proposed workflow is created inside a new
      sequence. The preview contains the activities that will be used in your automation. Hovering
      over an activity reveals the activity package to which it belongs.

Your instructions are
        also added as an annotation that can be used to edit the proposed workflow. If you are not
        satisfied with the structure created by Autopilot, you can refine your initial instructions
        by clicking inside the annotation, editing the description, and selecting the
          Generate button, which will create a new workflow preview.

After ensuring the
        workflow works as expected, select the Confirm button to have Autopilot build the
        workflow. You can also choose to keep the Sequence activity surrounding the resulting
        workflow by selecting the Keep surrounding sequence option, enabling you to further
        edit the generated workflow. Otherwise, select the Cancel button to discard the
        preview.

After the workflow is generated, you can modify your instructions by clicking
        inside the sequence's annotation. After selecting the Generate button this time, a
        message window informs you that all the current activities and their configurations will be
        lost and ask you to confirm the generation. Select OK to proceed with generating a
        new workflow based on your updated instructions or Cancel to keep the current
        workflow.

You can generate workflows from any
            sequence, including sequences placed inside another workflow.An Automation Cloud™ connection is
            required to access Autopilot functionalities.


### The Universal Search

The Universal search bar enables you to find snippets, activities, variables, arguments, imports, project dependencies, and files in your current project. Searches return results from all workflow files, including files that are closed.

![62a5471-Universal_search=GUID-BB798342-88F8-42ED-B528-AD4B687BD2AD=1=en=Default](/images/62a5471-Universal_search=GUID-BB798342-88F8-42ED-B528-AD4B687BD2AD=1=en=Default.png)


| Option | Shortcut | Description |
| --- --- ---| Current File | Ctrl + 1 | Lists results from the currently opened file that match the search query. |
| All Files | Ctrl + 2 | Lists results found in all files part of the current project that match the search query. |
| Activities | Ctrl + 3 | Lists results from activities that match the search query. |
| Variables | Ctrl + 4 | Finds variables in the current project that match the search query. |
| Arguments | Ctrl + 5 | Finds arguments defined in the project that match the search query. |
| Imports | Ctrl + 6 | Finds imported namespaces in the project that match the search query. |
| Project Files | Ctrl + 7 | Finds files part of the current project that match the search query. |
| Dependencies | Ctrl + 8 | Lists results found in dependencies installed to the project. |
| Snippets | Ctrl + 9 | Finds snippet files that match the search query. |

Search results persist until the next time you open the search bar if you use Universal search or Add activity. For Go to file and Jump to activity the previous search query is not persisted.

Double-click an activity or press Enter to add it to the currently opened file. Using the same commands, you can open files from under the All Files or Project Files category, or focus on the desired search result.

Default values of arguments from a process inside the Invoke Workflow activity are not searchable with the Universal Search.


### Go to File

The Go to file bar searches and opens files part of the current project folder. .xaml files are opened in the Designer panel in Studio, while other files, such as screenshots or Excel files, are opened with their respective default application on your machine. Double-click or press Enter to open a file.

![e27ef3e-go_file=GUID-A81ECE49-E60D-4A66-9FB7-0E6C4E938C88=1=en=Default](/images/e27ef3e-go_file=GUID-A81ECE49-E60D-4A66-9FB7-0E6C4E938C88=1=en=Default.png)

The Activities, Project panels, and the Command Palette support fuzzy search, which means that a list of results is returned even if the search terms don't match exactly. The search terms could be slightly incomplete, misspelled or include only the first letter of each word. For example, if you type dci in the Activities bar, it returns the Double Click Image activity.


### Jump to Activity

The Jump to activity search bar part of Command Palette helps find and focus specific activities in large workflows. It is accessed by using the Ctrl + J keyboard shortcut, or by opening using the F3 or Ctrl + Shift + P shortcuts, and selecting Jump to activity.

When opened, the Jump to activity bar displays the list of all activities in the .xaml file currently focused in the Designer panel.

Type the display name or the namespace of an activity, for example Assign. Use the keyboard arrows to select the activity and press Enter to focus it in the Designer panel.

Activities in the Jump to activity bar are arranged in the following order: container, parent, and child activities.

![5620940-jump_activity=GUID-BCB8CA3B-E988-4BA2-88C0-FF78C0E1EB9F=1=en=Default](/images/5620940-jump_activity=GUID-BCB8CA3B-E988-4BA2-88C0-FF78C0E1EB9F=1=en=Default.png)


## The Panels




### The Designer Panel

The Designer panel displays your current automation project, enables you to make changes to it, and provides quick access to variables, arguments and imports.

It is possible to navigate within a diagram by double-clicking the activity you want to view. The path is displayed as breadcrumbs in the header of the Designer panel. Please note that when using multiple displays scaled differently the text in the input field part of some activities might be improperly shown.

Activities can be copied using Ctrl + C shortcut or the context menu, to a text editor, receive changes, and then copied back to the Designer panel. You can undo / redo an action you performed in the panel using the buttons in the Studio ribbon or by pressing Ctrl + Z / Ctrl + Y.

![d49c7a3-flowchart_interface=GUID-DD6DF8DD-0FBE-4F57-B476-4EEFAE1251F4=1=en=Default](/images/d49c7a3-flowchart_interface=GUID-DD6DF8DD-0FBE-4F57-B476-4EEFAE1251F4=1=en=Default.png)

If an activity has validation errors, an error icon  is displayed on the right side of the activity title
      bar in the Designer panel and a warning icon  is displayed for all its parent activities. The error
      message is also displayed at the top of the Properties panel for the activity affected by
      the issue and can be copied by selecting the clipboard icon next to the message.

Activate Pan Mode by clicking the  icon, holding the Space key or pressing the middle mouse button. Use the zoom drop-down to change the zoom level and click the  icon to reset it back to 100%.

The Fit to Screen icon changes the zoom in such a way that the whole workflow fits in the Designer panel. Click the  icon to get an overview of the whole project and navigate through sections by adjusting the focus.

![82421d8-designer_options1=GUID-473FE134-C95A-4ED5-8754-87C7DF60ECD2=1=en=Default](/images/82421d8-designer_options1=GUID-473FE134-C95A-4ED5-8754-87C7DF60ECD2=1=en=Default.gif)

# Activity
        and sequence summarization with Autopilot™

Using Autopilot™ summarization
        capabilities, you can create meaningful names which clearly describe what an activity or a
        sequence is doing. This feature is particularly useful for improving the readability of
        large workflows, which can be hard to review or maintain.

To improve the clarity and
        consistency of activity names, Autopilot takes into account the elements that define the
        activity, including its description, arguments, properties, input values, and its
        corresponding package name and description. In the case of sequences, Autopilot creates a
        single-sentence summary from all the descriptions of the activities included in the
        sequence.

To use this feature, double-click the name of an activity or a sequence in the
      title bar (or select

Rename

from the activity or sequence context menu

), and then click the

Summarize Activity

button. Autopilot will then generate a unique name
      which describes what the activity or sequence does.

# The Context Menu

![93c64dd-conte=GUID-D9839BAF-A864-49A2-916A-9DF57F4C4E1E=1=en=Default](/images/93c64dd-conte=GUID-D9839BAF-A864-49A2-916A-9DF57F4C4E1E=1=en=Default.png)

The context menu enables you to perform several operations on your workflow, be it a sequence or a flowchart. You can display it by right-clicking an activity inside your workflow.

If you select more activities, the menu is not displayed at all.

Field Descriptions for the Context Menu

The Try clause encloses the activity to be checked for exceptions. The Catches clause is the exception handler. The Finally clause is used for executing an activity regardless of the status of the first two clauses.Extract as WorkflowCreates a new workflow containing the targeted activity with the purpose of breaking down a large project into smaller ones. In the place of the extracted activity an Invoke <new> workflow activity is created which enables you to edit and import arguments from the newly created workflow. The arguments are created automatically from the variables used in that activity. The Invoke <new> workflow activity automatically maps the local variables to invoke arguments for the extracted workflow. Please note that this applies only to variables you create, arguments are not created from variables created implicitly by parent activities such as For Each.Enable ActivityEnables a previously disabled activity.Disable ActivityDisables an activity, which is then placed inside a Comment out activity.Toggle BreakpointMarks the selected activity as a breakpoint for debugging. Breakpoints can also be toggled by clicking the Breakpoint button in the Execute tab.

### The Project Panel

The Project panel enables you to manage project files, dependencies, and configure project settings. For more information, see Managing Projects.


### The Data Manager Panel

The Data Manager panel enables you to manage data such as variables, arguments, constants, entities, Orchestrator resources, connections, and namespaces from a centralized location. For more information, see Using the Data Manager.


### The Activities Panel

![Activities_Panel2=GUID-3A57B6B9-CB01-48A6-A419-980A73709C52=1=en=Default](/images/Activities_Panel2=GUID-3A57B6B9-CB01-48A6-A419-980A73709C52=1=en=Default.png)

The Activities panel shows activities that can be added
      to the current workflow. In Windows and cross-platform projects, you can see both installed
      and available activities, while in Windows - Legacy projects only installed activities are
      visible. Installed refers to activities from packages that are already added as project
      dependencies, while available refers to activities from packages that are not installed, but
      are available for installation from the Official and Orchestrator Tenant
      feeds.

You can search for activities by name and optionally by description using the search box at
      the top of the panel, navigate through them using navigation keys, and press Enter to
      add the selected activity to the currently opened file.

The search box can be used for
      finding activities by their class name, regardless of the interface language set in
      Studio.

Hovering over an activity in the panel displays the package it belongs to and its
      description. To add an activity to the list of favorites, right-click it and select Add to
        favorites.

# Adding Available Activities

In Windows and cross-platform projects, you can quickly find and add activities from
        official UiPath packages that are not installed in your projects using the Available
        category in the Activities panel and the Add activity search bar.

To add an available activity to your project, double-click it or drag and drop it in your
        workflow. When you add an available activity to a project, the package that contains it is
        installed as a project dependency. You can also add an available package to your project by
        right-clicking its name and selecting Install.

Adding Integration Service Activities

Most Integration Service activities can be added only from the Available category. The
        activities are included in a single package, UiPath Integration Service Activities,
        enabling you to quickly add multiple activities for different connectors. The activities in
        this package are not displayed in the Installed section of the Activities panel.

When an update is available for an activity that is already added to a project, it is
        automatically updated whenever you add a new Integration Service activity or reopen a
        project.

To add Integration Service activities to a project:

1. Add an available Integration Service activity, or right click the name of the category in the Available section and select Install to add the UiPath Integration Service Activities package as a project dependency.
2. Add other Integration Service activities from the Available category, without installing additional packages. The available activities included in the Integration Service package are added to your workflow instantly.

For more information about working with Integration Service activities, see the Integration Service activities guide.

# Customizing the Activities Panel

Click the Search by description button at the top of the panel to search for keywords in the
        activities' descriptions.

Click the Group by button to group available activities by the category
        they belong to or by the package they belong to. You can also clear the two options to see
        an ungrouped list of activities arranged alphabetically.

The Properties panel is contextual and enables you to view and change the properties of a selected activity. When selecting two activities in the same workflow, common properties can be modified from the Properties panel.

In projects with the cross-platform compatibility, all activity properties are available in the
                  activity card in the Designer panel if the Show activity properties
                        inlinedesign
                        setting is enabled. This also applies to some activities in projects
                  using the Windows compatibility.

# The Expression Editor

The Expression Editor is accessible with the Ctrl + Shift + E keyboard shortcut when used inside activity input fields. It is also available from the Properties panel, from fields that require inputting text, and from the body of an activity, by adding text directly in the required fields.

![04d746f-expression_editor=GUID-8A076A6C-513E-4D3A-AB45-61E24FAD60EB=1=en=Default](/images/04d746f-expression_editor=GUID-8A076A6C-513E-4D3A-AB45-61E24FAD60EB=1=en=Default.png)

The Expression Editor includes intelligent code completion features. Expressions can be written on multiples lines. Keyboard shortcuts for creating variables and arguments directly in expressions are available.

Use Ctrl + F inside the editor to open the search and replace capabilities. Select part of an expression and press Ctrl + F3 to add the text to the search field. Hold the Ctrl key to make the search pane semi-transparent and see the text behind it.

When you close the editor, its position on the display, window size, and text zoom level are saved and applied the next time you open it.


### The Autopilot Panel

The Autopilot panel is a centralized AI-powered interface that simplifies the
            development and maintenance of your automation projects.

The panel gives you access to Autopilot™ summarization
            and workflow
                generation capabilities by using the top-level Summarize workflow and Generate sequence buttons.

Additionally, the panel improves error handling and troubleshooting by providing AI-based
            suggestions for resolving low-code  workflow errors while also displaying the original error messages. Select
            the Get suggestions button under the identified errors and Autopilot will provide
            detailed explanations for each error, as well as clear, context-aware recommendations
            that you can then apply to your workflow. These advanced capabilities also work with
            Workflow Analyzer errors.

You can also use the Autopilot panel to search the official UiPath documentation without
            navigating to the documentation portal from outside Studio. Simply select the
                Search button, type your question, and Autopilot will give the relevant
            answer, as well as guide you to the documentation source for more information.


### The Outline Panel

![32439d7-outline_panel=GUID-85A4CC13-FA6E-4BC2-8BFE-A592DB36D4E6=1=en=Default](/images/32439d7-outline_panel=GUID-85A4CC13-FA6E-4BC2-8BFE-A592DB36D4E6=1=en=Default.png)

The Outline panel displays the project hierarchy, and all available nodes. You can highlight activities in this panel by selecting them in the Designer panel, or you can go to a specific activity by selecting it in the Outline panel.


### The Output Panel

![367314e-output=GUID-2F8CBAA2-CD6B-4881-BD68-70319FA7A9E2=1=en=Default](/images/367314e-output=GUID-2F8CBAA2-CD6B-4881-BD68-70319FA7A9E2=1=en=Default.png)

The Output panel enables you to display the output of the Log Message or
                Write Line activities, among other things. Exceptions for packages are also
            displayed in this panel.

From the Output panel, you can show or hide messages that have different log
            levels (errors, warnings) by clicking the buttons in the panel’s header. Double-clicking
            a message displays further details about it, with the option to copy information.

When searching for a log in the Output panel and selecting an item from the search
            results list, the log is highlighted.

The Export Logs button is used for exporting logs into a .txt
            file. It exports timestamps and error message details as well. Exporting filtered logs
            is available. For example, if you want to export only trace level logs, filter the list
            and then use the Export Logs button.

When debugging, the Output panel shows logs for when an activity starts executing
            and until it ends. This can be enabled from the Log Activities option in the
                Debug tab.

The Error List panel displays errors found in the file or project during the
            validation process, together with errors generated by Workflow Analyzer rules.

The Clear All button erases all info displayed in the Output panel. Logs
            and other data stored in this panel are erased when a workflow is run. The Output
            panel displays up to 2,000 lines at a time.

The Output panel is not intended for production monitoring and should only be used
            when developing automations. Events might not be displayed as expected if, for example,
            a large number of Log Message activities are used. To monitor production runs,
            use the Orchestrator logs.


### The Find References Panel

The Find References panel displays results for references you search for in your project. To find every place in the project where an element is referenced, right-click it and select Find References. This works for the following:
