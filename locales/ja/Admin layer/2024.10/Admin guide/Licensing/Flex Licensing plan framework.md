The licensing information on this page applies to you if you are on Flex.If you are on Unified Pricing, refer to Unified Pricing: Licensing plan framework.

You can use {Delivery option} with a licensing plan to match your automation needs and budget.

## Plan overview

The following sections provide a high-level description of the licensing plans available in the Flex model.


### Community

A free plan that gives you instant access to elementary automation capabilities through licenses for users and UiPath services.

It is aimed at non-commercial use only. For commercial purposes, the Free plan is available.

This plan includes a set number of licenses, of which you cannot request any more. If you need additional licenses, you must upgrade to the Pro plan.


### Free

A free plan that gives you instant access to basic development and attended automation capabilities, which can be used for commercial purposes.

Starting with November 2022, new customers interested in trying out UiPath products for free can sign up at uipath.com.Existing Community users who were compliant with the terms and conditions that were in place when they signed up can continue using their Community plan. Those who are not compliant can switch to the Free, Pro Trial, Pro, or Enterprise plan.


### Pro Trial

A plan intended solely for internal non-production purposes, such as evaluation and testing, while fully complying with the Acceptable Use Policy outlined in our Terms of Use. It is available free of charge for a limited amount of time.

You can upgrade to the Pro Trial plan if you want to experiment with more robotic power and premium services. With a Pro Trial plan, you can try the extended platform capabilities that come with a paid Pro plan.

Upgrading from Community to Pro Trial gives you access to additional licenses and premium services at the platform level.

The evaluation period is limited to 60 days. After the trial expires, your organization is automatically downgraded to the Free plan.


### Pro

This is a plan that you can purchase in minutes through online license purchase. You can start using your new licenses and perks almost immediately.

The Pro plan grants your organization access to some premium features at the platform level.

Only some licenses are available for purchase with the Pro plan. To acquire licenses that are not available in the Pro plan, you must upgrade to the Enterprise plan.

For the full list of UiPath licenses, refer to the Flex Plan tab on the UiPath Licensing page.


### Enterprise

The Enterprise plan is a yearly plan which includes custom
            license types and license counts, tailored to your specific needs with help from our
            Sales team. To get started, you must contact Sales.

You can purchase as many licenses of each type as you want, and you
            gain access to the full stack of premium plan perks that are included with this
            plan.

You can also purchase products in bundles, called Platform SKUs. These
            are currently available under the form of two tiers, namely Standard and
                Advanced. The capabilites included in each tier differ, and are detailed on
            the UiPath Licensing page.

# Robot units
                fallback

Organization administrators can choose to enable a fallback
                mechanism for scenarios where robot units run out. Specifically, if you use Studio
                Web and you deplete your allocated robot units for running personal automations, you
                can be assigned extra robot units from the tenant pool.

To do that, the
                    License fallback option in the Edit license allocation window must
                be enabled.
