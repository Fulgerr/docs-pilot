# Frequently asked questions

# Renewal date and pro-rating

If you are adding licenses to an existing plan, whether it is a monthly or annual payment plan, you may have less than a full billing period before your next bill. So, for the current billing period, we do not charge the full cost of using a license for the entire period. Instead, we calculate the pro-rated cost for using the new licenses for the number of days you have left until your next payment.

For example, if you have roughly half a billing period left before your next payment date, the pro-rated cost is roughly half of the license cost because you only use the license for half of this billing period.

The pro-rated costs are shown in your order summary before you complete the purchase, whether it is a monthly or annual payment plan.

# License decrease

Only available for the Monthly payment plan.

If you updated your plan to decrease the number of some of your licenses, the change takes effect at the start of your next billing cycle. It starts on the date shown under Next payment date at the top of the organization-level Licenses page.

You can continue to use all of your licenses until then.

At this time:

* no refund is issued for the remainder of the month as you retain the ability to use the licenses.
* no payment is required - except if you also added new licenses as part of the same update to the plan, in which case you pay for the new licenses only.

Starting with your next billing cycle, you are charged only for the licenses you have at that time. The amount you are charged is adjusted to reflect the change in the number of licenses, and it is shown under New monthly bill on the order summary. This amount is lower than your original monthly bill by the cost of the removed licenses.

# I cannot update licenses for my plan

The Update licenses button can be unavailable due to certain temporary situations, thus preventing your from updating the license quantities in your plan:

* You paid using bank transfers and the payment for your current bill has not been processed yet.Unfortunately, there is nothing that you can do except to wait for the payment to go through. This should take at most 14 days from the date of your latest purchase.
* You have recently decreased the number of licenses in your plan.If you need to make further changes before your next billing cycle, proceed further within this section on how to do so.

Canceling pending changes

If you have decreased your number of licenses, this change remains in a pending state until your next billing cycle begins. While there are pending changes, you cannot update your plan. To be able to update your plan, you must cancel the pending changes and then, if needed, redo them as part of the plan update.

To cancel pending changes to licenses:

1. Go to Admin > Organization > Licenses and, in the banner at the top of the page, select View pending change.The Pending license decrease panel opens at the right of the window and lists the licensing changes that are pending.
2. If you plan to redo these changes later, note the license changes that you are canceling.
3. Select Cancel change.A confirmation dialog opens, informing you that this will increase you bill going forward.
4. Select Confirm to cancel the change.The pending change banner closes and the Upcoming bill value is updated.

# Reading the order summary for an updated license plan

In the top half of the order summary, you can view the New monthly bill/New annual bill value, which is the total amount you will need to pay each billing period, starting with the next billing cycle. This amount represents the new total cost for your subscription, including the changes for licenses that you are adding or removing.

In the bottom half, the Amount due today represents the one-time cost that you need to pay when you confirm the changes, whether it is a monthly or annual payment plan. This amount is lower than the monthly/annual cost because you are paying a pro-rated price for the newly-added licenses only. The pro-rated cost is calculated based on the number of days remaining in the current billing period, whether it is a monthly or annual payment plan. This is because you are only paying for the licenses for the remainder of the billing period, rather than for the full period.



# Payment failure for direct debit

If, at the top of the page in Automation Cloud, you notice a banner with information that online payment failed, your direct debit payment for your licensing plan subscription could not be settled.

When you notice the banner, you can assume the following activities happen:

* An email notification has been sent to the email address you provided as part of your business information at the time of your first purchase.
* Your organization has been downgraded to the Free licensing plan.
* You may also notice a license overallocation message on the Licenses pages if the revoked licenses are still allocated to users or tenants.

To obtain the licenses and licensing plan you had before, you must reattempt the purchase. After payment is settled, the banner disappears.

# Payment failure for card payments

If we were unable to charge the card you provided on the payment date, we retry the payment for up to three days after the due date. If, after three days, we are still unable to settle the payment, we automatically downgrade your organization to the Free licensing plan.

# I can't view the direct debit payment option

Direct debit may not be available as a payment option due to the country in which your business is located, or the currency in which you selected to pay.

* If your business is from Canada, Mexico, or Japan, direct debit is not available as a payment option.You can pay using a card instead.
* If your business is from another country and you have chosen US Dollar (USD) as the currency, then the direct debit option is not available. This is because the SEPA Debit option requires payment in Euro (EUR).You can either pay by card in USD, or at first payment you can change the selected currency to EUR so that you can pay using direct debit.

Depending on the country of your business, you can pay using:

* ACH Debit: To use this type of payment, your business must be from the United States of America (USA), and your chosen currency must be US Dollar (USD).
* SEPA Debit: To use this type of payment, your business must be from a country other than the USA, Canada, Mexico, or Japan, and your chosen currency must be Euro (EUR).
