# Configuring system email notifications

Email notifications provide alerts for events like password recovery, license status, product updates, and resource-specific notifications such as job or robot alerts.They can be configured at two levels: host and organization. The host-level applies settings across all organizations in the platform, but they can be overriden at the organization level.Notifications can be related to user accounts (password recovery), or be related to events from services such as Orchestrator.

## Using default email settings

Default email settings are preconfigured parameters provided by UiPath for sending system email notifications. Default settings use the SendGrid SMTP server and are designed to work out of the box, requiring no additional customization.

Default email settings are preconfigured parameters provided by UiPath for sending system email notifications. Default settings use the SendGrid SMTP server and are designed to work out of the box, requiring no additional customization.When selected at the host level, the default UiPath email settings apply to the host and all of its subordinated organizations. The host can also have custom email settings.Whatever configuration - default or custom - that is set at the host level, it propagates down to all child organizations that did not customize their own email settings. Organization custom settings override the inherited settings from the host.When the default mail settings are chosen at the organization level, settings from the host level - either the standard UiPath or any custom host configurations - are adopted. Nevertheless, these settings can be overridden at the organization level with custom configurations.
