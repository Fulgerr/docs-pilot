# Manual migration

This page outlines the manual steps to perform data migration from your on-premises Orchestrator
            tenants to Cloud Orchestrator services. This method requires that you manually recreate
            your on-premises configuration and entities in your {Delivery option}organization.

### Manually recreating your Orchestrator setup

You must perform the following operations in Orchestrator, as described in the table, and make sure that you have the required permissions.


| Step | Operation | Details |
| --- --- ---| 1 | Configure tenant settings | On the General tab, adjust the time zone of the tenant, the language of the user interface for Orchestrator, and toggle the Modern Folders feature.On the Deployment tab, configure and secure the automation packages feeds.On the Mail tab, configure email settings.On the Scalability tab, specify if the Robot service should subscribe to Orchestrator's SignalR channels, and configure the transport protocols that work best for you.On the Non-Working Days tab, define a list of non-business days, per tenant, on which you may configure your schedules to not run. |
| 2 | Configure alert subscription settings | To receive alerts for a category, you need to have the corresponding permissions on that category as well. |
| 3 | Create folders and subfolders, and assign users to them accordingly | Perform this step if you need more folders.Adding users to an Orchestrator service in Cloud Portal also results in adding them to the Default Classic folder, if it exists and it hasn't been renamed. |
| 4 | Add credential stores | Only Azure Key Vault and Orchestrator Database are supported as credential stores. Other third-party stores are not available in Cloud Orchestrator. |
| 5 | Create assets |  |
| 6 | Publish packages from Studio or upload them manually |  |
| 7 | Upload libraries | In Cloud Orchestrator, you can only publish libraries at service level. To share libraries between Orchestrator services, you can use a custom feed. |
| 8 | Define triggers |  |
| 9 | Provision machines |  |
| 10 | Create Robots in classic foldersORManage Robots in modern folders | In classic folders, Robots need to be added to environments.ORIn modern folders, Robot settings are controlled at user level. Robots are automatically provisioned for users with access to the new modern folder.Environments are not used in the context of a modern folder. |
| 11 | Deploy processes |  |
| 12 | Create action catalogs |  |
| 13 | Create queues |  |
| 14 | Create webhooks | You can define webhooks at any point, depending on when you want to be notified during the migration. |
| 15 | Disconnect your Robots from the on-premises instance and then connect each Robot to your Orchestrator service | Robots can be connected to only one source at a time. When a Robot is disconnected from the on-premises Orchestrator and connected to Cloud Orchestrator, it automatically consumes a new license from {Delivery option}. |
