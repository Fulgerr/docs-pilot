# Context Grounding licensing

This page provides details on how Context Grounding requests are quantified through
            licensing units.

# Unified Pricing

The licensing information in this section applies to you
                    if you are on Unified Pricing. For details, refer to Licensing plan framework.

Context Grounding consumes Platform Units for each request (search, summarization, or RAG
                operations) as it is executed through the supported UiPath product surfaces.

The consumption of Platform Units occurs in the following way: for every request, 0.2
                Platform Units are used.

# Flex Licensing

The licensing information in this section applies to you
                    if you are on the Flex plan. For details, refer to Licensing plan framework.

Context Grounding consumes AI units for each request (search, summarization, or RAG operations)
                as it is executed through the supported UiPath product surfaces.

The consumption of AI units occurs in the following way:When you use Context Grounding with GenAI Activities, an additional AI Unit
                        is charged. For example, if you use the Content Generation without
                        Context Grounding, the run execution charges 1 AI unit. If you use
                            Content Generation with Context Grounding, the run execution cost
                        is 2 AI unit.Autopilot activities are measured
                        through Autopilot actions, not AI units. When you use Autopilot, with or
                        without a Context Grounding query, the cost remains the same: 1 Autopilot
                        action. For more information on Autopilot actions, refer to the Autopilot licensing page.Agent activities are measured through
                        agent units, not AI units. For more information on agent units, refer to the
                            Agents licensing page.
