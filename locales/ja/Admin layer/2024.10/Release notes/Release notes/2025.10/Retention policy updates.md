# Retention policy updates

We know that streamlining your database is as important to you as it is for us. This is why we are taking our retention policies up a notch by adding the option to delete or archive non-terminal state jobs and queue items.

This new option is integrated in the existing retention policy component at the process level for jobs, and at the queue level for queue items. It is available via a new set of fields dedicated to uncompleted jobs and queue items, respectively.

The default values for jobs and queue items are as follows:

* Completed The default duration is 30
                        days.The maximum duration is 180
                        days.
* Uncompleted The default duration is 180
                        days.The maximum duration is 540
                        days.

The uncompleted job and transaction
                archiving will not take effect until March 2025. Until then, change the setting as
                needed to suit your particular scenario.
