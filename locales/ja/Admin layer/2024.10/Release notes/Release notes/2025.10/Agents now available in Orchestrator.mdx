# Agents now available in Orchestrator

We are excited to announce that, as part of our wider UiPath Agents rollout, Orchestrator now offers full support for agents.

Agents are advanced digital tools designed to work independently and leverage generative AI and large language models (LLMs) to interpret natural language, make real-time decisions, and take action. Perfectly tailored for dynamic use cases, equipped with AI skills that allow them to plan, think, act, and learn, agents have the power to transform the way enterprises work.

For further information on agents, refer to the Agents user guide.

Additionally, you can now monitor agents specifically by using the new Process type filter in the Enhanced monitoring view. For more information, refer to Filters.

# Availability

Agents are now available for a limited number of Enterprise customers, before being released to general availability (GA) for everyone. The staged release allows us to gather essential feedback from first usage, while skipping the regular public preview phase. This guarantees that features are ready for production environments, not just testing. Between this initial release and full general availability, we plan to bring valuable new features and significant improvements to our agents. Stay tuned!
