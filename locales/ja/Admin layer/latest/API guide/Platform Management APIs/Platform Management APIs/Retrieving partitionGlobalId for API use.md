# Retrieving partitionGlobalId for API use

Retrieving the partitionGlobalId is a critical step when using the API for managing users and groups. This parameter represents the organization's ID for which you intend to manage accounts. Follow this guide to learn various methods to retrieve your partitionGlobalId.

# Understanding partitionGlobalId

The partitionGlobalId parameter must be included in the request body when making API requests. It uniquely identifies the organization you're managing.

If you erroneously fetch or use this parameter, you'll encounter an error message similar to this:'{"errors":{"partitionGlobalId":["The value 'DatacomGroup' is not valid."]} '. This indicates that the entered partitionGlobalId value isn't valid.

# Method 1 - Fetching partitionGlobalId from the URL

Your partitionGlobalId is embedded in the URL displayed when you log in.

For instance, consider the following URL: https://baseURL/tenant/portal_/cloudrpa?organizationId=xxxxxx&ecommerceRedirect=false&isAuth0=true, xxxxxx is the partitionGlobalId. However, grabbing this might be challenging as the URL may load too quickly.

# Method 2 - Using Developer Tools to retrieve partitionGlobalId

To get around the swift loading issue, follow these steps:

1. Open your web browser's developer tools before logging in. On Windows and Linux, you can open developer tools using the keyboard shortcut Control + Shift + J. On Mac, you can open developer tools using the keyboard shortcut Command + Option + J.
2. Navigate to the Network tab and enable recording.
3. Log in to {baseURL_vanilla} and select your desired tenant.
4. Once the page fully loads, go back to the developer tools, on the Network tab.
5. Examine the requests made while the page was loading. Look for a request, such as the Settings API request.
6. In the Request URL of this specific request, you'll find partitionGlobalId followed by an ID. This ID is your partitionGlobalId and is the value to be used in your API calls.
