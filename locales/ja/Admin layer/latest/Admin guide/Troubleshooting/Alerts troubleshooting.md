## Not receiving alerts for groups with SAML provisioning rule

Problem: Users do not receive configured alerts either in the user interface or via email when those alerts are configured for user groups with a SAML provisioning rule.

Solution: To resolve this issue, you can add affected users to the Administrators local group which allows them to receive alerts.

Adding users to the Administrators group grants them with elevated privileges. Endeavor to understand the implications of these privileges. Ensure users are conferred administrator rights responsibly, maintaining a balance between the need for alerts access and preserving system security.
