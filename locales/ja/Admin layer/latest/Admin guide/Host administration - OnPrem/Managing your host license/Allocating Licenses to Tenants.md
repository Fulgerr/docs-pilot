# Allocating Licenses to Tenants

You can only allocate licenses to tenants from the Orchestrator host portal.

This section only concerns enabled tenants which are to be licensed using a joint license, the host license. You cannot allocate licenses to a tenant which is using an individual license unless you first remove it.

### From the Tenants Page

1. In the Tenants page, select the More Actions button for a tenant and select Allocate Licenses. The Allocate Licenses window opens. If the tenant is individually licensed you must first remove the existing license before starting to allocate new ones.At the end of each row, in blue you can view the number of available licenses out of the total number at host level.
2. Edit the values on the left to allocate licenses as needed, keeping in mind that you cannot exceed the total number available.
3. Select Allocate. The Tenants page updates to reflect your changes.


### From the License Page
