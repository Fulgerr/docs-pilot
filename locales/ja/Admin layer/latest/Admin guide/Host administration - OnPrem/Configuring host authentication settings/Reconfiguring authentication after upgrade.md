# Reconfiguring authentication after upgrade

If you are upgrading Orchestrator to this version and you've previously enabled any external identity provider authentication, there are a series of manual configurations to be performed at the external identity provider level.

Previously created users are propagated to the UiPath Identity Server database.

UiPath Identity Server acts as a federation gateway for a series of external identity providers (Google, Windows, Azure AD, and SAML2). You can configure their settings from the Management portal, under Users > Authentication Settings, in the External Providers section.

### Manual configuration after an upgrade

Upon upgrading to this version of Orchestrator, any external identity provider authentication enabled in Orchestrator is automatically migrated to Identity Server, along with all the existing users. However, some manual changes are required after the upgrade.
