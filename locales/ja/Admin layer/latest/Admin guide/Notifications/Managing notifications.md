Only Organization Admins can manage the notifications for a user group or organization.

## Subscribing external AD group to
    events

Here is how to subscribe an entire external AD group to events
      for email notifications. Only notifications about events that impact user groups are sent to
      external AD groups.

Prerequisites: For users from the external AD group to
      receive email notifications, perform the following steps:Access the external AD user group account
          in Outlook.Go to Group Settings, and then
            Edit Group.Select Let people outside the
            organization email the group.

          page.Change the view from My Notification to Manage Notification.Select Add user group, to add an external AD group as a notification
          profile.Search the name of the external AD group you added inside your tenant and select it.
        Select Configure.Go to a service tab (Actions, for example), and choose the default events the
          external group should be subscribed to.Select the checkboxes under Email to choose the default events the users in the
          external group are subscribed to.After you finish the configuration, select Save. When configuring notifications for an external Active Directory (AD) user group of type Security group, users within this group will not
            receive email notifications.

## Notifications outbound static IP addresses

You can configure Notification Service systems to use SMTP servers from your own on-premises or cloud networks. If you want to provide additional security to your Notification service system, you can protect it with a firewall, and only allow Notification Service's outbound static IP addresses through it.

However, these IP addresses used by Notification service for external communication can sometimes change as a result of infrastructure deployments. To help you stay informed about any changes, we've organized a list of current outbound static IP addresses, shown in the following table:

# Outbound static IP addresses

IP static addresses20.213.69.140/3020.92.42.116/3020.220.159.8/3020.104.134.160/3020.239.121.152/3020.232.224.12/3020.78.114.120/30104.215.9.124/3020.166.153.132/3020.198.150.140/3020.23.210.168/3020.66.65.144/30

Additionally, you can subscribe to updates to be notified of any changes 30 days before they are carried out. This way, you can ensure that your list of allowed IP addresses is always up to date.
