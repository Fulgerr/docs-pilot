# App registrations


## Overview

UiPath business extentions are applications that are external to your UiPath platform and can be granted secure access to UiPath resources without having to share user credentials.

UiPath business extentions are made available for consumption across all organizations by going through a rigorous validation
                process and then registered by an organization administrator.


## Validation process

To make a UiPath business extention available and ready for registration, it must undergo a rigorous validation process. Once vetted, the application will show up in Admin > External applications page > App registrations tab > Available applications.
