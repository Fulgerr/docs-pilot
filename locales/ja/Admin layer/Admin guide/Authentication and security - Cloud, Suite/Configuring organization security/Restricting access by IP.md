# Restricting access by IP

This feature is available on all tiers in the Enterprise licensing plan.

If you want to secure access to your organization and only allow users that are within your corporate network to access it, you can specify the IP addresses you want to allow and we block all other traffic.

### Before you begin




### Adding trusted IP ranges

If your private network uses a known set of IP addresses, you can add them in Security Settings to only allow users from those addresses to access your organization.

Go to Admin.Make sure that the organization is selected at the top of the left pane and then select Security Settings.The Security Settings page for the organization opens.Along the top, select the IP Restriction tab:Add a set of IP addresses.You can add trusted IP ranges one by one by selecting Add trusted IP range, or add them in bulk by selecting Upload CSV. For detailed instructions, navigate further.

After you enable IP restriction, as described further, only users and programs that have an IP that was declared in one of the trusted IP ranges can access your organization. If the IPs are not declared, the users encounter an Access forbidden message when trying to access the organization.

Next steps: After you have added all of the IP sets, proceed with the instructions in the next section to enable IP restriction.
