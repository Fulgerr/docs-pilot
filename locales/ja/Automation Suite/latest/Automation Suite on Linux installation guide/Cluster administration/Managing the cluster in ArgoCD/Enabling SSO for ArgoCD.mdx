You must generate the RBAC file and
            the Dex configuration file before enabling SSO for ArgoCD.


### Enabling SSO for ArgoCD

After preparing the RBAC and the Dex configuration file, you can enable SSO for ArgoCD:

1. Update the cluster_config.json file with the following parameters: fabric.argocd_dex_config_file - enter the path to the previously created Dex configuration file.fabric.argocd_rbac_config_file - enter the path to the previously created RBAC file.
2. Rerun the installer: ./bin/uipathctl manifest apply /opt/UiPathAutomationSuite/cluster_config.json --versions versions/helm-charts.json
