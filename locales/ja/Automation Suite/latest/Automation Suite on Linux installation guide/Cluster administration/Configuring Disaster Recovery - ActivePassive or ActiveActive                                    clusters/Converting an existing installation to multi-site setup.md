# Converting an existing installation to multi-site setup

If you exited the Automation Suite setup, you can convert that into multi-site by taking the following steps:

1. Convert the standalone Automation Suite cluster into the primary cluster. For details, see the following section.
2. Install secondary Automation Suite cluster. For details, see Disaster Recovery - Installing the secondary cluster.

### Converting a standalone cluster into a
    primary cluster

To convert an existing Automation Suite cluster into a primary cluster of the multi-site
      deployment, take the following steps:

1. Update cluster_config.json.
2. Configure the infrastructure on the
          first server node.
3. Configure the fabric and services on the
          first server node.

# Updating cluster_config.json

Add or modify the required cluster_config.json parameters on the first server node.
        For more details, see the following documentation: Advanced installation
        experience

It is
          recommended to keep the FQDN of your existing Automation Suite setup to avoid
          reconfiguring all your robots.

# Configuring the infrastructure on the
        first server node

1. Navigate to the installer folder:cd /opt/UiPathAutomationSuite/{version}/installer
2. Run the following command on the first server node:./bin/uipathctl rke2 update-fqdn -i /path/to/cluster_config.json -o output.json --versions version.jsonThis will update all the other nodes in the cluster, including the remaining server nodes, agent nodes, and specialized agent nodes.

# Configuring the fabric and services on
        the first server node

To configure the fabric and services on the first server node, run the following
        command:

./bin/uipathctl manifest apply cluster_config.json --versions version.json
