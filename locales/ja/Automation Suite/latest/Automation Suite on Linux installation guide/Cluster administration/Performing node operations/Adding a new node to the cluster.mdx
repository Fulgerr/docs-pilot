# Adding a new node to the cluster

You can add server and agent nodes to the deployment after installation to increase resourcing.Adding nodes is supported in both the single-node evaluation profile and the multi-node HA-ready production profile. However, adding nodes in a single-node environment will not result in a multi-node HA-ready production environment as we do not support the transition between the two deployment profiles.For instructions on how to download the packages required for adding a new node, see Downloading installation packages.To add a new node to the cluster, take the following steps:

Configure the node to connect to the load balancer. For details, see Configuring the load balancer.Download the installation packages and get them on the machines.Configure the disks.Configure the node ports.Validate and install the required RPM packages.Copy the cluster_config.json from an existing machines to the new one.Validate the prerequisites for the installation.To add a new node, run one of the following commands:To navigate to the installer folder, run the following commands. Replace <VERSION> with the actual installer version.chmod -R 755 /opt/UiPathAutomationSuite
cd /opt/UiPathAutomationSuite/<version>/installerTo add a new server node, run the following commands:./bin/uipathctl rke2 install -i ./cluster_config.json -o ./output.json -k -j server --accept-license-agreementTo add a new agent node, run the following commands:./bin/uipathctl rke2 install -i ./cluster_config.json -o ./output.json -k -j agent --accept-license-agreement
