# ArgoCD goes into progressing state after first installation

# Description

Whenever the cluster state deviates from what has been defined in the helm repository, argocd tries to sync the state and reconciliation happens every minute. Whenever this happens, you can notice that the ArgoCD app is in progressing state.

# Solution

This is the expected behavior of ArgoCD and it does not impact application in any way.
