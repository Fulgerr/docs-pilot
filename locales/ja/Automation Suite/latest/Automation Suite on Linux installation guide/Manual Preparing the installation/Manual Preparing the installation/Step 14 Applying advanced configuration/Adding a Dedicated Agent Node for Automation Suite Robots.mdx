# Adding a Dedicated Agent Node for Automation Suite Robots


### Requirements

Before starting the Automation Suite Robot installation, make sure you meet the hardware requirements.

* In a single-node evaluation installation, Automation Suite Robots run on the main server node. Cached packages are stored on the main node’s filesystem, in a folder that the interactive installer automatically provisions. Adding a dedicated agent node for Automation Suite Robots is optional in single-node evaluation installations. In a single-node evaluation installation, the number of concurrent serverless jobs is limited to 5.
* In a multi-node HA-ready production environment, adding a dedicated node for Automation Suite Robots is mandatory. For details on the requirements the dedicated node must meet, see Hardware and software requirements. In a multi-node HA-ready production installation, the maximum number of concurrent serverless jobs is determined by the node’s resources (CPU/memory).
* A minimum of 10GB are required for package caching.
