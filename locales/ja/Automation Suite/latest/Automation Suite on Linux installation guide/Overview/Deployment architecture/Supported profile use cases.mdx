# Supported profile use cases

The single-node mode is only suitable for evaluation purposes, whereas you can use the multi-node profile in production.

Single-node (evaluation) deployments can be converted to
                high availability (HA) setups by adding the additional hardware required for
                multi-node deployments. For more details, refer to the  page.

Automation Suite supports the following deployment modes, each targeted at specific use cases, as explained in the following table:


| Deployment mode | Description |
| --- ---| Single-node — evaluation | Supported only for evaluation and demo scenarios. |
| Multi-node — production, HA-enabled | Lite:Supported for production deployments.Non-HA by default, but you can set specific services to HA.HA: Supported for production deployments. You can perform additional configuration post-deployment to have full HA capabilities. |

### Context and considerations

Automation Suite uses a cloud native architecture based on Kubernetes. It provides all the benefits in scale, automatic resource management, and reliability that come with Kubernetes.

To offer these benefits, the Kubernetes design is based on the following fundamental aspects:

* Running on an uneven number of multiple machines (3, 5, 7, etc.);
* Using the quorum principle to handle independent node failures and data corruption. For a cluster of N machines, as long as there is still a number of N/2 + 1 machines that have quorum, the cluster is functional and can recover gracefully with no observed failures.
