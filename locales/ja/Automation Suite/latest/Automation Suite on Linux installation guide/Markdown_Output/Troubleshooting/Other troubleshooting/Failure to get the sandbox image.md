# Failure to get the sandbox image

# Description

You can receive an error message specific when trying to get the following sandbox image: index.docker.io/rancher/pause3.2

This can happen in an offline installation.

# Solution

Restart either rke2-server or rke2-agent (depending on whether the machine that the pod is scheduled on is either a server or an agent).

To check which node the pod is scheduled on, run kubectl -n <namespace> get pods -o wide.

# If machine is a Master node
systemctl restart rke2-server
# If machine is an Agent Node
systemctl restart rke2-agent
