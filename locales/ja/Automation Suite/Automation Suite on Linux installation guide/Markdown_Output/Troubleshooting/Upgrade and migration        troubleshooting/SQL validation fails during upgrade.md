# SQL validation fails during upgrade

# Description

When trying to upgrade to a new Automation Suite version, validateUiPathASReadiness.sh can fail to validate SQL connectivity.

The validateUiPathASReadiness.sh script uses the podman command to run containers to verify the SQL connection.

If there is any corruption in the Podman system data, the podman command can fail to run and, consequently, can cause the validateUiPathASReadiness.sh execution to fail also.

# Solution

You can verify if there is any Podman data corruption by running the podman volume ls or podman secret ls command. If the previous commands fail, you can reset the Podman files by running the podman system reset command.

The podman system reset command stops all Podman containers and removes all images, volumes, networks, and container content.
