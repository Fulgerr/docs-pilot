### as-installer.zip

as-installer.zip is an installation package that contains the main installation and supporting scripts. The package also contains the uipathctl tool.

If you choose the offline installation profile, you must download as-installer.zip. If you opt for the online installation profile, as-installer.zip is automatically downloaded by the interactive installation wizard.

The as-installer.zip file is required during installation, upgrade, cluster restore in the event of disaster, and while adding new node to existing cluster.


### uipathctl

Required. uipathctl is a UiPath® command-line tool that allows you to run
            commands against Automation Suite. You can use uipathctl to check
            prerequisites in your environment, install Automation Suite, configure and manage it
            from a single unified CLI.

Currently, uipathctl is only compatible with the x86 architecture.
                You cannot run uipathctl on machines based on the ARM architecture,
                such as Macs with Apple Silicon (M series) CPUs.


### Full as.tar.gz

as.tar.gz contains the container images and deployment manifests of UiPath® Shared Capabilities and UiPath® Product. The bundle is approximately 30 GB in size.

The full as.tar.gz is ideal for users with strong network connections who wish to download the complete file in one go.

If you opt for the offline installation profile, you must download as.tar.gz. If you choose the online installation profile, Kubernetes will pull all the container images and deployment manifests directly from the container registry hosted in UiPath® servers.

as.tar.gz is required during installation and upgrade only on server node when using internal Docker registry.


### Split as.tar.gz

as.tar.gz contains the container images and deployment manifests of UiPath® Shared Capabilities and UiPath® Product. The bundle is approximately 30 GB in size.

The split as.tar.gz is designed for users with restricted networks, or those who may encounter challenges when downloading larger files.

If you opt for the offline installation profile, you must download as.tar.gz. If you choose the online installation profile, Kubernetes will pull all the container images and deployment manifests directly from the container registry hosted in UiPath® servers.

as.tar.gz is required during installation and upgrade only on server node when using internal Docker registry.


### du-ondemand.tar.gz

du-ondemand.tar.gz contains base images to install Document Understanding packages.
