# Using a firewall

We do not support firewalld. The Automation Suite installer automatically disables firewalld during installation; make sure it remains in a disabled state post-installation as well.

Automation Suite sets up default IP table rules on the host machines for necessary inter-node communication. We do not support custom IP table rules, such as those configured via firewalld, as they might conflict with IP table rules configured by Automation Suite. You can, however, apply extra firewall rules at the network level.

Changes to IP tables are not recommended or
                supported.

We recommend enabling firewall applications at the network gateway, but not between clusters.
