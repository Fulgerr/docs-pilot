# Unable to connect to AutomationSuite_ProcessMining_Warehouse database using a pyodbc format connection string

# Possible cause

SQL Server is in the SQL Server Always On Availability Group and a listener is used to route the traffic between data centers.

# Possible solution

Remove the listener from the SQL Server Always On Availability Group and make sure to include the SQL Server instance name in the connection string.
