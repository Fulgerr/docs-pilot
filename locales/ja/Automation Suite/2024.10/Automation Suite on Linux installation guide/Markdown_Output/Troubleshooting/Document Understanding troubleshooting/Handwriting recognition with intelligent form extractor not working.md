# Handwriting recognition with intelligent form extractor not working

# Description

Handwriting Recognition with Intelligent Form Extractor not working or working too slow.

# Solution 1

If you are using Intelligent Form Extractor offline, please check to ensure that you have enabled handwriting in the configuration file before installation or enabled it in ArgoCD.

To double check, please go to ArgoCD > Document Understanding > App details > du-services.handwritingEnabled (set it to True).

In an air-gapped scenario, the Document Understanding bundle needs to be installed before doing this, otherwise the ArgoCD sync fails.

# Solution 2

Although handwriting in the configuration file is enabled, you might still face the same issues.

Please know that the default for the maximum amount of CPUs each container is allowed to use for handwriting is 2. You may need to adjust handwriting.max_cpu_per_pod parameter if you have a larger handwriting processing workload. You could update it in the configuration file before installation or update it in ArgoCD.

For more details on how to calculate the parameter value based on your volume, please check the documentation here.
