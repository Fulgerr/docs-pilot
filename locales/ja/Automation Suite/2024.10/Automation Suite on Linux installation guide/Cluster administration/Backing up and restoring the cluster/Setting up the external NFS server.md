# Setting up the external NFS server

You can set up the NFS server on any machine and any OS of your choice or alternatively use any PaaS service offered by cloud providers. Note that we do not support Windows-based NFS and Azure blob-based NFS.

This document provides the instructions specific to configuring the NFS server on the RHEL operating system.

### Installing and configuring the NFS server

The following steps to configure the NFS server represent just one of the possible ways. UiPath® does not recommend any specific steps here. You are free to install the NFS server using any other method you prefer.


### Allowing all nodes to access the NFS mount path

All backup and restore nodes must be able to access the NFS mount path.To provide access, take the following steps:

Go to the /etc/exports file on the NFS server.Add an entry for the FQDN for each node (server and agent) for both the backup cluster and the restore cluster. Make sure to use the following format: mountpath fqdn-of-node(rw,sync,no_all_squash,root_squash).

Example:The following example shows how to add an entry in the /etc/exports file. The entry specifies the FQDN of a nodes in the cluster and the corresponding permissions on that machine.echo "/asbackup node1.automationsuite.mycompany.com(rw,sync,no_all_squash,root_squash)" >> /etc/exportsTo export the mount path, run the following command:exportfs -arv
exportfs -s
