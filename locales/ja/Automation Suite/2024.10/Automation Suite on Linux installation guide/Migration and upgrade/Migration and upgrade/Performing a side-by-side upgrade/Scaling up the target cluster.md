# Scaling up the target cluster

This step is applicable only when you are following the Side-by-side upgrade (single node
            start).

To scale up the target cluster, follow these steps:

1. Perform sanity check on the single node target cluster. Make sure it is
                    functional and the migrated data is intact.
2. Check the 
                    page for the detailed steps on converting a single-node deployment to a
                    multi-node setup. To reduce the infra requirements, you can clean the nodes from the source cluster
                    and add it to the target cluster one by one. Do not dismantle all the nodes of
                    source cluster at once. For removing the nodes from the source cluster, check the  page.
                    Before you proceed with the uninstallation of Kubernetes, ensure you delete the
                    node from the cluster using kubectl delete node. The nodes set to join the target cluster must be clean and should not contain any
                    data corresponding to the old cluster. If you are removing the nodes from source cluster
                        and joining to the target cluster, it is strongly recommended to create a
                        backup of the source cluster and the SQL database before the scale up. This
                        is to ensure you can restore the source cluster if something goes wrong
                        while scaling up the target cluster.
3. After converting the target cluster to HA setup, you can retain the same FQDN as the source
                    cluster or update the FQDN. After updating the FQDN, switch the traffic to the
                    new cluster. Before updating FQDN, you must add the required certificates to match the
                        FQDN.To update the FQDN, refer to the 
                        page. Changing the FQDN also requires new server certificates. If a new
                            certificate is available, you have two options: either continue with the
                            new self-signed certificates configured by the installer automatically,
                            or stop the installation and bring in a new certificate.You can configure the certificate via the
                                server_certificate field in
                                cluster_config.json.
4. In case of failure or issues during the side-by-side upgrade process, you can
                instantly roll back to your previous state by disabling maintenance mode on your
                source cluster by following the  page. If you have decommissioned any nodes from source cluster, you can add them back by
                    following the  page.
5. Enable the backup on the cluster target.
