Q: Can I deploy Automation Suite in Active-Passive mode?A: Yes.

# Untitled Section

Q: Can I deploy Automation Suite in Active-Active mode?A: Yes.

# Untitled Section

Q: How many HAA licenses do I need for configuring Active/Passive?A: You need a total of two HAA licenses, one for each cluster. Each of
                the licenses must be for two shards.

# Untitled Section

Q: Do I need to bring additional product licenses for the passive
                cluster?A: No, once you apply the licenses on the primary cluster, they are
                available to use in the secondary cluster as well.

# Untitled Section

Q: Can I turn off the secondary cluster while not in use?A: Yes, in the case of an Active-Passive setup, you can switch off some or
                    all nodes in the secondary cluster while not in use. In the case of
                        an Active-Active setup, nodes on both clusters must be up and
                    running.

# Untitled Section

Q: Can I install unsupported products in the secondary cluster?A: No, you cannot install products that are not supported in the
                secondary cluster. If you try such an installation, the products will be
                unusable.

# Untitled Section

Q: Can I rebuild the primary cluster using the secondary cluster when
                the backup is unavailable?A: No, to rebuild the primary cluster, you need a backup. However, you
                can rebuild the secondary cluster using the primary cluster.

# Untitled Section

Q: Can I deploy an in-cluster objectstore with Active-Passive or
                        Active-Active configurations?A: No, multi-site deployments have a strict requirement for external
                objectstore.

# Untitled Section

Q: Can I perform cluster management when one of the Automation Suite
                clusters is unavailable or switched off?A: You must perform most operations, such as SQL connection string
                update, on both clusters. Therefore, both clusters must be available. However,
                if the cluster is unavailable, and you must update a configuration, you can
                de-link the clusters and operate individually.

# Untitled Section

Q: If a product is down in the primary cluster, can I only switch the
                traffic for that product to secondary?A: Only site-level fault tolerance is allowed. Granular product-level
                tolerance is not supported right now.

# Untitled Section

Q: Can I choose not to deploy a product in multi-site?A: You must install all products on both sites. You cannot choose to
                deploy a product only on one side except to discover products and
                Insights.

# Untitled Section

Q: Can I bring heterogeneous machines in both clusters?A: You can bring different configurations of machines on both sites as
                long as those machines meet the hardware and software requirements for an
                Automation Suite installation.

# Untitled Section

Q: Can I bring lower-spec machines for the secondary cluster?A: Yes, you can choose to deploy a smaller or fewer machines in the
                secondary cluster. This can be done to save some cost when Insights, Task
                Mining, Process Mining, and Automation Hub are not installed.

# Untitled Section

Q: Can I run the training pipeline in the secondary cluster?A: You can schedule the training pipeline only on the primary cluster.
                This means training pipeline functionality is temporarily unavailable when the
                primary cluster is down.

# Untitled Section

Q: Can I use the same Automation Suite/product license on both
                sites?A: Though both clusters are individual clusters, they are configured to
                behave as a single deployment. This also means you do not have to provide two
                separate Redis licenses.

# Untitled Section

Q: Can I promote the secondary cluster to the primary cluster?A: No, you cannot promote the secondary cluster to the primary
                cluster.

# Untitled Section

Q: Can I convert the multi-site deployment back to a standard Automation
                Suite setup?A: No, this is currently not possible. The only option is to recreate
                the setup from a backup.

Q: What happens when the primary cluster is temporarily down in
                    Active-Passive mode?A: When the primary cluster is temporarily down, Automation is
                temporarily unavailable. You must switch the traffic to the secondary cluster
                using the steps described here.

# Untitled Section

Q: What happens when the primary cluster is temporarily down in
                    Active-Active mode?A: When the primary cluster is temporarily down, products that support
                    Active-Active mode should not experience any downtime. However, products that do
                    not support Active-Active mode, such as Insights,Automation Hub, Process Mining,
                    and Task Mining will be temporarily down. In this case, you should try to bring
                    back the primary cluster.

Q: What happens when the primary cluster is permanently down in
                    Active-Passive mode?A: When the primary cluster is permanently down, Automation is
                temporarily unavailable. You must switch to the secondary cluster using the
                steps described here, then rebuild
                the primary cluster from backup.

# Untitled Section

Q: What happens when the primary cluster is permanently down in
                    Active-Active mode?A: When the primary cluster is permanently down, products that support
                    Active-Active mode should not experience any downtime. However, products that do
                    not support Active-Active mode, such as Insights,Automation Hub, Process Mining,
                    and Task Mining will be down. You must switch the traffic to the secondary
                    cluster, then rebuild the primary cluster from backup. After the primary cluster
                    is up, re-enable the traffic to both clusters.

Q: What happens when the secondary cluster is temporarily down in
                    Active-Passive mode?A: When the secondary cluster is temporarily down, Automation Suite is
                not impacted. However, Disaster Recovery is not available. Once the secondary
                cluster is back, re-apply any configuration made on the primary cluster to the
                secondary cluster.

Q: What happens when the secondary cluster is temporarily down in
                    Active-Active mode?A: When the secondary cluster is temporarily down, Automation Suite is
                    not impacted. However, it will not be able to serve the requests as it would
                    have done with both the clusters up. Also, Disaster Recovery is not available.
                    Once the secondary cluster is back, re-apply any configuration made on the
                    primary cluster to the secondary cluster.

Q: What happens when both clusters are permanently down in Active-Passive
                    mode?A: When both clusters are permanently down, the entire Automation Suite
                is down. To bring back the setup, you must restore the primary cluster using a
                backup, and re-build the secondary cluster from the primary cluster.

Q: What happens when any of the products is down in the primary cluster in
                    Active-Passive mode?A: When any of the products is down in the primary cluster, that product
                is not be available. There is no way for you to switch the traffic only for that
                product in the secondary cluster. And vice-versa. Only site-level fault
                tolerance is possible.

# Untitled Section

Q: What happens when any of the products is down in the primary cluster
                    in Active-Active mode?A: If the product that is down supports Active-Active mode then there
                    will be no down time for that product as the secondary will be serving the
                    requests. However, if the product does not support Active-Active mode, such as
                    Insights,Automation Hub, Process Mining, and Task Mining, then that product will
                    experience a downtime.

Q: What happens when the primary data source is down, and the data is not
                    replicated to the secondary data source in Active-Passive mode?A: In this case, there would be data loss. Your RPO would govern the
                data loss. The promotion of the secondary data source to the primary would be
                governed by your RTO.

Q: What happens when the primary data source is back after a brief downtime
                    in Active-Passive mode?A: When the primary data source is back after a brief downtime, you must
                ensure that unless all the data is re-synced back to the original data source,
                you do not start redirecting traffic to the primary cluster.

Q: What happens when both data sources are down in Active-Passive
                    mode?A: In this case, you should expect complete downtime. A few inflight
                transactions may be stuck in that state forever.
