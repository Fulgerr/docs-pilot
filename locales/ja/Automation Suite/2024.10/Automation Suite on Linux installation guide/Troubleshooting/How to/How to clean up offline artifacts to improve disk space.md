# How to clean up offline artifacts to improve disk space

If you run an offline installation, you typically need a larger disk size due to the offline artifacts that are used.

Once the installation completes, you can remove the local artifacts. Failure to do so can result in unnecessary disk pressure during cluster operations.

On the primary server, where the installation was performed, you can perform a cleanup using the following commands.

1. Remove all images loaded by podman into the local container storage using the following command.: podman image rm -af
2. Then remove the temporary offline folder, used with the flag --offline-tmp-folder. This parameter defaults to /tmp: rm -rf /path/to/temp/folder
