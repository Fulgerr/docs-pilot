# Step 2: Deploying Automation Suite to GCP Marketplace


### Configuring the deployment

To configure the deployment, provide details such as the service account, region, zone, installer version, server and agents, services, and then select Deploy to complete the operation.

If you run the deployment but uncheck the Perform installation checkbox, you
                must install Automation Suite manually after the deployment concludes. For manual
                installation instructions, see Manual: Preparing the installation.


### Completing the deployment

To ensure the deployment was successful, we recommend checking the deployment status.
