# Enabling Data Service

To be able to create and use Data Service you first need to enable it for your tenant. Before enabling the service please check the Prerequisites.

Data Service is a tenant level service signifying that each tenant data is segregated.

## Enabling Data Service in Automation Suite

There are two scenarios that enable Data Service as part of your Automation Suite instance:


### The Case of a Fresh Automation Suite Installation

Data Service is provided as part of the Automation Suite basic profile, hence it is enabled
      automatically, regardless if you select the basic or the complete profile. To disable Data
      Service, follow the Advanced installation experience in the Automation Suite guide for
      the desired version.


### The Case of an Automation Suite Version Upgrade

To enable Data Service after upgrading the Automation Suite version, follow the Managing
        products - Enabling or disabling Data Service guide for the desired version.
