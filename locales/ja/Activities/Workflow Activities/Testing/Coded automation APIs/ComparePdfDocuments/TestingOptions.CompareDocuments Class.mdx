# Properties

AdditionalOutputFilePathPath to the additional output file. Needs to be set if
                            OutputDiffType is PDF.GenerateSemanticResultPerform the verification using the AI capabilities that
                            AutopilotTM offers to obtain a semantic interpretation of the
                        differences. This generates an additional result with the semantic
                            differences.Depending on licensing plan you
                            enrolled in, the Semantic result type consumes one of the
                            following for each coded automation API execution:For the Flex
                                    licensing plan, the Semantic result type consumes one AI
                                    unit.For the Unified
                                    Pricing licensing plan, the Semantic result type consumes
                                    one Platform unit.For more information on consumption, visit .IgnoreIdenticalItemsIf set to True, identical items are ignored during
                        comparison. This is useful when comparing static objects, such as watermarks
                        or headers. By default, this is set to True.IgnoreWidgetsLocationIf set to True, ignores the location of an image or URL in
                        the compared documents. By default, this is set to
                        False.IncludeWidgetsIf set to True, the comparison process also includes images
                        and URLs. By default, this is set to True.OutputDiffTypeDocumentOutputDiffTypeThe type you want to use for returning the differences between the
                        documents.OutputFilePathThe output path of the base document.Rules<ComparisonRule>List of rules to be applied. They can be of type RegexRule
                        or WildcardRule.WordSeparatorsThe objects, as Strings, that you want to consider as word separators in the
                        comparison process. For example, if the documents you are comparing commonly
                        use a period . or backslashes / for
                        separating words, then you can define these as word separators.
