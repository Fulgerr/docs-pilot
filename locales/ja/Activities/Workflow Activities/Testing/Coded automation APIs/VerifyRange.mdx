                        error. The default value is False. As a result, if the field is blank and an
                        error is thrown, the execution of the project stops. If the value is set to
                        True, the execution of the project continues regardless of any error.alternativeVerificationTitleStringThis will be displayed in orchestrator.takeScreenshotInCaseOfFailingAssertionBooleanIf set to True, takes a screenshot of the target process if
                        the verification has failed.takeScreenshotInCaseOfSucceedingAssertionBooleanIf set to True, takes a screenshot of the target process if
                        the verification has been successful.

# Return value

Boolean

It is “True” if the Verification passed/succeeded, and “False” if the Verification
                failed.

# Configuring the
                    outputMessageFormat

The outputMessageFormat parameter can be configured with supported
                arguments, that act as placeholders for the values used in the verification
                operation. These placeholders are automatically populated with the variables or
                values defined when invoking the coded automation API at runtime.

For the VerifyRange coded automation API, you can implement the following supported
                arguments when creating an output message:

* {Expression}: Represents the value of the expression you provided for the expression parameter.
* {ExpressionText}: Represents the text of the expression you inserted for the expression parameter.
* {Operator}: Corresponds to the verificationType parameter.
* {LowerLimit}: Indicates the variable name you used for the lowerLimit parameter.
* {LowerLimitText}: Refers to the textual representation of the variable used for the lowerLimit parameter.
* {UpperLimit}: Represents the variable name used for the upperLimit parameter.
* {UpperLimitText}: Points to the textual value of the variable used for the upperLimit parameter.
* {Result}: Represents the coded automation API's return value, which is the verification result.

The following is an example on how to use the VerifyRange coded automation API, which
                includes configuring the outputMessageFormat parameter:

// Initialize a variable for the expression to be verified
var Expression1 = 23;

// Employ the VerifyRange coded automation API, with the last string parameter being the outputMessageFormat
testing.VerifyRange(Expression1, VerificationType.IsWithin, 1, 25, "The {Expression} should be greater than {LowerLimitText}, and less than {UpperLimitText}");

In the provided example, the placeholders within the curly brackets are replaced with
                the corresponding variable names and their values at runtime, providing a customized
                output message.
