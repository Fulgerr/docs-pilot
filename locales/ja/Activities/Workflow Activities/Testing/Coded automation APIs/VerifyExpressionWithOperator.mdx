                        error. The default value is False. As a result, if the field is blank and an
                        error is thrown, the execution of the project stops. If the value is set to
                        True, the execution of the project continues regardless of any error.alternativeVerificationTitleStringThis title will be displayed in orchestrator.takeScreenshotInCaseOfFailingAssertionBooleanIf set to True, takes a screenshot of the target process if
                        the verification has failed.takeScreenshotInCaseOfSucceedingAssertionBooleanIf set to True, takes a screenshot of the target process if
                        the verification has been successful.

# Return value

Boolean

It is “True” if the Verification passed/succeeded, and “False” if the Verification
                failed.

# Configuring the
                outputMessageFormat

The outputMessageFormat parameter can be configured with supported
                arguments, that act as placeholders for the values used in the verification
                operation. These placeholders are automatically populated with the variables or
                values defined when invoking the coded automation API at runtime.

For the VerifyExpressionWithOperator coded automation API, you can implement the
                following supported arguments when creating an output message:

* {LeftExpression}: Represents the value of the first expression you provided for the firstExpression parameter.
* {LeftExpressionText}: Represents the text of the first expression you inserted for the firstExpression parameter.
* {RightExpression}: Represents the value of the second expression you provided for the secondExpression parameter.
* {RightExpressionText}: Represents the text of the second expression you inserted for the secondExpression parameter.
* {Result}: Represents the coded automation API's return value, which is the verification result.
* {Operator: Represents the operator used in the verification, set by the operatorValue parameter.

The following is an example on how to use the VerifyExpressionWithOperator coded
                automation API, which includes configuring the outputMessageFormat
                parameter:

// Initialize variables for the expressions to be verified
var expression1 = "User created succesfully";
var expression2 = "successfully created user";

// Employ the VerifyExpressionWithOperator coded automation API, with the last string parameter being the outputMessageFormat
testing.VerifyExpressionWithOperator(expression1, Comparison.Contains, expression2, "{LeftExpression} {Operator} the {RightExpression}, so the verification is {Result}.");

In the provided example, the placeholders within the curly brackets are replaced with
                the corresponding variable names and their values at runtime, providing a customized
                output message.
