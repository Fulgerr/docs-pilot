# Test Case Name Not Unique Within Project

Rule ID: TA-NMG-001

Scope: Workflow

# Description

This rule checks whether a test case is unique or not, regardless of its location folder or subfolder.

You can apply this rule only for test cases that have been published. This helps you to exclude template files or temporary backups.

# Recommendation

Keep your test case filename unique and enforce this rule for reporting, traceability and audit-proof purposes. For example, it is difficult to differentiate between test cases in Orchestrator and Test Manager if you have duplicate filenames.
