# Add Test Data Queue Item

UiPath.Testing.Activites.AddTestDataQueueItem

# Description

Adds a DataRow to a specified TestDataQueue.  Unlike Add Queue Item, you can add this activity as a container, then drag any activity with an output parameter inside of it. Your activities will be added one by one to the DataRow, and subsequently to the queue, so you don't have to store them in a DataTable.

Misc

* ContinueOnError - Specifies if the automation should continue even when the activity throws an error. This field only supports Boolean values (True, False). The default value is False. As a result, if the field is blank and an error is thrown, execution stops. If the value is set to True, the execution of the project continues regardless of any error.
* Folder Path - the path to the Orchestrator folder where the Test Data queue is located.
* Private - If selected, the values of variables and arguments are no longer logged at Verbose level.

# Windows, Cross-platform configuration
