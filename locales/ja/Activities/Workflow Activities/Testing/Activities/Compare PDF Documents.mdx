* Baseline Path - The path of the base document used as a reference for comparison. You can also select the Choose a file option, and browse for the file on your machine.
* Target Path - The path of the document compared against the base document. You can also select the Choose a file option, and browse for the file on your machine.
* Output Folder Path - The folder path where the two output files will be saved.
* Interpret differences with Autopilot: Perform the verification using the AI capabilities offered by AutopilotTM to obtain a semantic interpretation of the differences.This option generates an additional output named Semantic Differences, and removes the Comparison Type property.Enabling the Interpret differences with Autopilot option consumes one of the following, depending on the licensing plan your enrolled in:For the Flex licensing plan, the Interpret differences with Autopilot option consumes one AI unit for each activity executionFor the Unified Pricing plan, the Interpret differences with Autopilot option consumes one Platform unit for each activity execution.

Input

* Comparison Type - The type of comparison to use when comparing documents. This property is available only if the Interpret differences with Autopilot option is disabled. The following options are available:Line - Compares the documents line by line.Word - Compares the documents word by word.Character - Compares the documents character by character.
* Rules - The list of rules that you want to use to exclude certain sections from comparison. Input the comparison rule output variables you created using the activity.Select Open Collection Builder and add the rules as entries.
* ContinueOnFailure - Specifies if the automation should continue even when the activity throws an error. This field only supports Boolean values (True, False). The default value is False. As a result, if the field is blank and an error is thrown, the execution stops. If the value is set to True, the execution of the project continues regardless of any error.
* Ignore Identical Items - If set to True, identical lines are ignored during comparison.
* Include Widgets - If set to True, the comparison also includes images and URLs.
* Ignore Widgets Location - If set to True, the position and page of images and URLs are ignored when comparing the documents.

Output

* Differences - Represents a list of differences resulted from the comparison process. Each Difference comprises an Operation, which signals the type of modification with possible values such as Equal, Inserted, or Deleted, and a Text element that highlights the specific content correlated with the operation.
* Result - Defines the final result. It displays True if the verification succeeds and the documents are equivalent. It displays False if the verification does not succeed, indicating differences between the documents.
* Semantic Differences - This property is only available if you previously selected the Interpret differences with Autopilot result type. Semantic differences represent the results of the document verification process achieved using the AI capabilities of AutopilotTM.
