# New features

New JavaScript capabilities for HTML callouts

We introduced a set of UiPath-specific JavaScript APIs that empower you to create highly interactive and responsive custom HTML callouts. These APIs can be seamlessly integrated into your HTML callouts, enabling you to enhance user interactions and trigger workflow events.

Visit  and  to learn how the APIs work and how you can use them to build custom callouts.

Precise callout to element binding

Callouts are now seamlessly bound to UI elements at runtime. This means that your callouts will precisely point to the UI element they're associated with, providing an enhanced user experience.

Automatically closing forms

It is now possible to set a specific time for your callouts to automatically close. Additionally, you can still manually control when the callouts close.

# What's New

# New callout experience

This release brings a new and improved callout experience across UiPath. The determining improvements for callouts are greater performance, and the ability to reuse callouts as forms, because they're both uiform files.

The improvement of the activity package also marks a new attended automation solution, where forms and callouts can cover the majority of attended scenarios, using triggers, and global variables. Learn about the Trigger-based Attended Automation solution here.

# Show Callout

After you build your callout using the Form Builder, the same way you would create a form file, you can go ahead and decide how to display your callout, using the  activity. This activity allows you to not only display multiple callouts at the same time, but also display multiple instances of the same callout at the same time.

## v2.0.5

Release date: 27 February 2023

General improvements added to the performance of the activity package.

## v2.0.3

Release Date: 3 November 2022

# Improvements

* Added support for the zh-TW locale code, representing the Chinese language used in the Taiwan region.
* Enhanced keyboard accessibility when using the Callout.Activities package.

# Bug Fixes

* When using the UiPath.Form.Activities v.1.1.11 package, the digital signatures were missing from the UiPath.Callout.Activity.Design and UiPath.Callout DLL files.


## v2.0.2

Release Date: 23 August 2022

To use the UiPath.Callout.Activities v2.0.2 package you need to install the UiPath.Form.Activities v2.0.2 package.

# What's new

With this release, the Callout Designer has split from the UiPath.Form.Activities package and is now part of the UiPath.Callout.Activities package.

The UiPath.Callout.Activities package contains the Callout Designer activity that allows you to create customized callouts. You can target customized callouts on UI elements in the apps integrated in your automation. The Callout Designer is the only activity available in the package.

# Improvements

* Improved Callouts to be scrollable at runtime, in order to display larger sized content.

# Bug Fixes

* When you submitted a form with a Button of type Submit, the Dismissed output property was not set as expected.
* An Object Reference - related error was generated when closing the Callout Designer without clicking the Save button.
* When the ExecuteDoBlockFirst property was selected, and the Do block was empty, the form kept running indefinitely. Now, the form stops running, as expected.
* When you used the UiPath Callout Designer in Dark Mode, the text inside the Content component did not display, unless selected.
* In the Conditional tab of a form component, when you configured Simple conditions, the 'When the form component' drop-down list did not show all the components used by the form. Now the drop-down list is complete, as expected.
* When a Callout was closed, as specified with the Timer property, the variable specified in the Dismissed output property field was set to False. The behavior of this variable was inconsistent. Now, when a Callout is closed, as specified with the Timer property, the Dismissed variable is set to True, as expected.
* Fixed a bug that was causing high CPU and memory usage when adding a Callout Designer Editor activity in the workflow, due to the spawning of multiple CefSharp processes.
