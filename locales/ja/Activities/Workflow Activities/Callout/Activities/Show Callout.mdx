# Show Callout

UiPath.Callout.Activities.ShowCalloutActivity

# Description

Use this activity to show a callout for a certain UI element. At runtime, the callout
                bounds to the UI element through an arrow pointing towards it. The callout shown is
                a .uiform file, essentially acting as a real-time form, which you
                create using the Form Builder. You can adjust the display properties of the
                    .uiform file to resemble a callout.

You can use callouts in the context of Trigger-based attended automation.

The activity involves the following steps:Selecting the
                            uiform file to show.The UI element next to where
                        you want to show the callout.Bind values to the components
                        inside the callout, using the Arguments
                        collection.As any other uiform file, you can show multiple instances of
                the same callout, using the Instance Name property.

                        callout.Show window
                                frame(Boolean) - Choose if you want
                        to show the margin of the callout window.WidthInt32 - Set the
                        width of the callout window, in screen pixels. HeightInt32 - Set
                        the height of the callout window, in screen pixels. Instance
                                Name - Set a name for this form instance. You can
                        use this name inside other activities, to uniquely identify this

                        even when the activity throws an error. This field only supports Boolean
                        values (True, False). The default value is False. As a result, if the
                        field is blank and an error is thrown, the execution of the project stops.
                        If the value is set to True, the execution of the project continues
                        regardless of any error.Automatically Close
                            After - Set a time after a callout should automatically close. If
                        you leave this field empty, then the callout will only close manually.
