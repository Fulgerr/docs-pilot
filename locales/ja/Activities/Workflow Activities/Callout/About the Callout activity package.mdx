# About the Callout activity package

The UiPath.Callout.Activities package allows you to build and design custom callouts to
            guide users through attended automations. The interface uses drag-and-drop components
            that bind the callout fields to the variables in your workflow. Not only can you show
            multiple callouts at the same time, but you can also show multiple instances of a
            callout at the same time. You can use this activity package in the context of Trigger-based attended automation.

You can create callouts using the Form Builder that you use to create forms, as well. Callouts are also uiform files. The main difference between callouts and forms, is that callouts are bound to an UI element, following it if it's moving, or not showing if the element is hidden.

You can also create callouts using custom HTML files, similarly to how you would create an HTML form file. Check out this tutorial to learn how to build a custom HTML form or callout file.Given that callouts are uiform files, you can use activities from the Form.Activities on them, as well. For example, if you're showing a callout, and you want to update its form values at runtime, you can use the Set Form Values activity.
