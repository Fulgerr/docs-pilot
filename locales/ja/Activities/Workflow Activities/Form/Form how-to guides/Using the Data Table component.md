# Using the Data Table component

The Data Table component allows you to display and
            work with large amounts of data. The other components that you add inside of it are
            displayed as a table view. This tutorial demonstrates how to bind a data table variable
            to a Data Table component, display it, and edit it at runtime.

Add a Build Data Table activity and build a table similar to the one
                    below:Name (String)Age (Int32)EmailAddress (String)John Doe45jonh.doe@yahoo.comMary Jane65mary.jane@yahoo.comAnne Doe44anne.doe@gmail.comRemember the exact names of the columns, because you will use them as the
                        Property Names for the components inside the Data
                    Table.Save the datatable in a variable. For this example, name it
                        outputDataTable.Open or create a Form, and add a Data Table component. In the Field Key tab, set the Property Name as, for this example,
                        datatable.Add other form components that should hold the data from the datatable.Text Field - set the Property Name as Name (the
                            exact name of the first column).Number - set the Property Name as Age (the exact
                            name of the second column)Text Field - set the Property Name as EmailAddress
                            (the exact name of the third column).Add a Show Form activity into the workflow, and select the form you
                    created at step 1.In the Arguments collection, bind the datatable to the Data Table
                    component.Add an entry and for Key input the Property Name of the
                                Data Table For this example, input datatable.Set the Type as System.Data.DataTable.Set the Direction as In.In the Value field, input the variable where you store the data
                            table created at step 1.For this example, add outputDataTable.Run the workflow and explore the Data Table component
                    capabilities.
