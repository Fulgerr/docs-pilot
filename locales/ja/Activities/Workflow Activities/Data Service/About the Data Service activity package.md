# About the Data Service activity package

The Data Service Activities pack enables you to fully utilize the power of the Data Service by making it possible to manipulate data stored in UiPath Data Service in your automation workflows. These activities allow you to execute operations such as create, update, read, search, or delete on records stored in Data Service Entities.

Check out the Using Entities in Projects page to see how to use them.
