# Release notes


## v3.0.0

Release date: February 7, 2025

# Breaking change

The 3.0.0 version of the UiPath.Pipelines.Activities package causes a breaking change for workflows built with previous versions of UiPath.Pipelines.Activities (2.x.x and lower). This is due to the introduction of the Tenant argument instead of Orchestrator URL.

If you want to reuse the workflows that you created with package versions 2.x.x or lower, inside projects that use versions 3.0.0 or higher, you must reconfigure the Tenant and Folder name arguments for the following activities (if applicable):

* Download Package
* Publish Package
* Run Tests
* Update Process

# Solutions Activities General Availability

The Solution activities are now out of the preview state and generally available (GA).

# Introducing the Run Existing Test Set activity

The new  activity allows you to run an existing test set created in Orchestrator.

# Run Tests activity enhancements

The Run Tests activity includes the following new arguments:

* Attach Robot logs - (Optional) Allows you to include the test set execution logs in the report.
* Number of retries - (Optional) Indicates the number of reattempts for failed test cases.

# General improvements

The UiPath.Pipelines.Activities package includes the following improvements:

* Update ProjectPackager and StandaloneAnalyzer to 24.10. The activity package requires .NET 8 due to ProjectPackager update.
* Various bug fixes.
