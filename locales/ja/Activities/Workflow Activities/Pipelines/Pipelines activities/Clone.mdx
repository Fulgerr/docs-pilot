# Clone

# Description

The Clone activity is used to fetch a UiPath project from the master branch of the GitHub repository and save it to a specified local folder.

# Project compatibility

# Configuration



* Repository URL - The GitHub repository URL from which the project is cloned.



Common

* Continue on error - (Optional) Specifies if the automation should continue even when the activity throws an error. This field only supports Boolean values (True, False). The default value is False. As a result, if the field is blank and an error is thrown, the execution of the project stops. If the value is set to True, the execution of the project continues regardless of any error.
* Timeout (miliseconds) - Specifies the amount of time (in miliseconds) to wait for the activity to run before an error is thrown. The default value is 60000 (1 minute).

Input

* Commit SHA - (Optional) The commit identifier. It must be set to the injected CommitSha argument; if not, the branch settings will be disregarded and the most recent commit to the main branch will be used instead.
* Destination path - (Optional) The local folder to save the cloned project. If left empty, a folder is created in the local robot runtime folder.
* Access token - (Optional) Only needed if the code has to be fetched from a GitHub repository not integrated with Automation Ops. If the connection between Automation Ops and GitHub is already created, permission is inherited from there.

Output

Repository Path - The path to where the source code has been cloned. Typically used to be passed to the Build activityIf you want to provide a folder for the Destination Path parameter, we recommend to keep it unique per process run, to be reference-able for administrative reasons, and to have a descriptive name (e.g. ProcessName_PipelineName_RunId).If you do not provide a value for the Destination Path parameter, a new folder is created for each run.
