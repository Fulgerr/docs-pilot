# Stage

# Description

The Stage activity is used to create a step in the pipeline and contains one or more Pipelines Activities. To better monitor pipeline execution, the Stage activity reports its status to Automation Ops.

Automation Ops displays pipeline steps only for Stage activities used at the first-level inside the main sequence. If Stage activities are nested inside other activities, they are not presented as Pipeline steps.

A best practice is to use a single pipeline activity in a Stage, this way, if the stage fails, it becomes easier to troubleshoot and mitigate any issues.
