# About the Pipelines activity package

The UiPath.Pipelines.Activities package allows you to create automations that build, clone, test, or publish your automation projects. It simplifies task management within your automation process.

Use cases for this package are available as templates in UiPath Studio and Studio Web (Templates tab).You can use the following templates:

* Build and promote with approval pipeline: Usage: management of an automation project from inception to approval.Steps: Clone, Analyze, Run Test, Build, Publish Package, Update Process, Approve, Download Package, Upload Package, and Update Package.
* Update process from a code line : Usage: highlights a streamlined procedure for updates and modifications to ongoing processes.Steps: Clone, Analyze, Build, Publish Package, and Update Process.

Combined with Automation Ops - Pipelines, you can set up a continuous-integration/continuous-delivery (CI/CD) system to manage the automation projects code, making development predictable and scalable.

The UiPath.Pipelines.Activities package supports Workflow only, not Flowcharts. The reporting capabilities are present only in the initial stage of the Main workflow (not working in other workflows or with conditional statements such as if/else).
