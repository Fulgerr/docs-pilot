# Broadcast Message

UiPath.IPC.Activities.BroadcastMessage

Enables you to send a message on a specified channel that, when received by a Message Receiver Trigger activity, activates another section of a parallel process.

In order for this activity to function properly, the package version used for the process that listens for the message via the Message Receiver Trigger activity must be identical to the one used for this activity.

# Properties

Common

* ContinueOnError - Specifies if the automation should continue even when the activity throws an error. This field only supports Boolean values (True, False). The default value is False. As a result, if the field is blank and an error is thrown, the execution of the project stops. If the value is set to True, the execution of the project continues regardless of any error.If this activity is included in Try Catch and the value of the ContinueOnError property is True, no error is caught when the project is executed.

Input

* Channel - The channel you want to use to send the message. This channel also needs to be set in the Message Receiver Trigger activity you want to activate. This field supports only strings and String variables.
* Message - The message you want to send to the designated trigger. This field supports only strings and String variables.
* PollingInterval - The waiting time (in milliseconds) between attempts to discover a channel where the message can be broadcast. The minimum value is 1 millisecond. This field supports only Int32 variables.
* Timeout - The amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait for the channel to exist before dropping the message. If the value is 0, the message is dropped. If the value is not 0, and the timeout passes without sending a message, then the following exception is thrown: "Timeout of x ms has passed and no channel was found to send the message to." This field supports only Int32 variables.

Misc

* DisplayName - The display name of the activity.
* Private - If selected, the values of variables and arguments are no longer logged at Verbose level.
