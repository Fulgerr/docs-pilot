# Flow Switch

System.Activities.Statements.FlowSwitch

A Flowchart specific activity that splits the control flow into three or more branches, out of which a single one is executed based on a specified condition.

# Cases

All the possible sequences out of which a single one is executed, based on its match with the provided Expression. The connected activities are automatically numbered, and the first one is the default case. You can change the case number or assign a different default case by clicking the corresponding arrow and changing the value of the Case field, or, respectively, selecting the IsDefaultCase check box.  If none of the cases match the Expression, the Default case is executed. If no Default case is added, the project is executed, but the activity does not return any output.

You can only assign one default case. Default cases are not numbered.
