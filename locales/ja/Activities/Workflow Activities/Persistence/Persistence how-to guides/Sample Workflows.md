# Sample Workflows

The Snippets panel in UiPath Studio stores XAML files added by users. The sample XAML files are stored in folders. The folder that stores XAML files used in long-running workflows is called Orchestration.

The sample XAML files are read-only. You need to create a separate Process in Studio, where you replicate the activities and configurations found in the snippets.

These snippets represent sample workflows created with the activities available in the
                Persistence activity package.

Prerequisites

* To develop long-running workflows, based on the workflows in the Snippets panel, you need to have the UiPath.Persistence.Activities package installed.
* We recommend using the Orchestration Process template to start building long-running workflows.

# Add Queue Item and Wait till completion

This snippet creates a Queue Item and suspends the workflow until the processing of that Queue Item is completed.

1. Drag an Add Queue Item And Get Reference activity into your workflow.This activity adds a Queue Item into a Queue container located in Orchestrator, using In/Out parameters. Then it retrieves the corresponding data about the newly created Queue Item Object into a QueueItemData type variable, in order to suspend the workflow, until the Queue Item is added into the Queue. See the Add Queue Item And Get Reference page for more information about the activity.When the Queue Items are added to the Orchestrator Queue, all QueueItemData type variables will be populated with the data retrieved from Orchestrator.In the Item Information collection, create a parameter with the Direction In/Out and set the value as a variable that you want to pass as a Queue Item. For this example, pass a String variable named Test.In the QueueItemObject(Output) property field, press CTRL + k on your keyboard and create a QueueItemData type variable, to store the data about the queue item, after it was created in Orchestrator. For this example, create a QueueItemData variable named QueueItemObject.
2. Drag any activities that you want to run before the workflow is suspended to retrieve data about the queue item. In this snippet, the Any steps to be executed before suspending the workflow section is commented out, acting as a container inside which you can place activities that won't be executed at runtime.
3. Drag a Wait For Queue Item And Resume activity into your workflow.This activity waits for a Queue Item to be added and processed in Orchestrator, in order to retrieve data about it and map it back into the workflow, inside the QueueItemData type variables. See the Wait For Queue Item And Resume page for more information about the activity.In the Queue Item Object (Input) property field, pass the QueueItemObject variable, to reference the exact queue item that you wanted to add to Orchestrator.In the Queue Item Object (Output) property field, press CTRL + k on your keyboard and create a QueueItemData type variable to store the data about the queue item after it was processed and retrieved.
4. Add a Write Line activity into your workflow, to print out the Queue Item that you added in Orchestrator. For this example, in the Text property field, pass the Test variable.

# Create External Task and Suspend till completion

This snippet creates an External Action and suspends the workflow until the user completes the action.

2. Populate the TaskDataCollection property window with arguments that pass information In, Out, or In/Out. For this example, create three arguments, each of them with a different Direction: In, Out, and In/Out. Set the Type as String. For the Value field, press CTRL + K on you keyboard and create three variables, that either give information (for In type arguments), or extract information ( for Out type arguments).For this example, create three String type variables:InVariable - the Value of the argument of type In. OutVariable - the Value of the argument of type Out. InOutVariable - the Value of the argument of type In/Out.In the Task Object (Output) property field, press CTRL + k on your keyboard and create an ExternalTaskData type variable. For this example, name the variable TaskPersistData. This ExternalTaskData object is used to pass data from Orchestrator, in order to let the Robot know that until a specific Action task is completed, the workflow is suspended.
3. Add any activities that you want to run before the workflow is suspended to retrieve data about the ExternalTaskData object.For this example, drag and drop a Sequence activity into your workflow and populate with three Write Line activities.

Pass the following values in the Text property fields: InVariable, OutVariable, InOutVariable.
4. Drag a Wait For External Task and Resume activity into your workflow.This activity suspends the workflow until an External Task is completed, and then maps it back into the workflow, inside the ExternalTaskData type variables.
