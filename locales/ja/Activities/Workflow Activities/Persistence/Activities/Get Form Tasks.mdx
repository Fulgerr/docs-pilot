# Get Form Tasks

UiPath.Persistence.Activities.FormTask.GetFormTasks

# Description

Helps you query a single Action or a set of Actions filtered by specific criteria, namely the Action's DTO properties:

* Status
* Title
* ID
* Priority
* TaskCatalogName
* AssignedToUser
* CreatorUser
* LastModifierUser
* CreationTime
* LastModificationTime
* OrganizationUnitID

The output object of the Get Form Tasks activity can be used in any other persistence activity, for example Wait For Form Task And Resume, to cover the scenarios that require another workflow to wait on the Actions, different than the workflow that created those Actions (for example, building a recovery workflow in case the current job fails). You can also pass the output object to a different process as input, so that you don't need to wait for all the Actions to be completed until the initial process resumes.

* Filtering and querying the actions uses the OData syntax, based on the action's metadata.

* Task Catalog Name - The action's catalog name that was set using the Create Form Task activity.
* Reference - The Action reference that was set using the Create Form Task activity.
* Filter - The OData filter option, used to filter the retrieved actions by the specified criteria. This field supports only strings and String variables. For example, Status in ('Pending', 'Unassigned'), and Priority eq 'High'.
* Select - The OData select option, used to retrieve a subset of the action's properties. You are required to input the ID option. Therefore, if you want to retrieve the Action Catalogs, the query you would use is "Id, TaskCatalogName". This field supports only strings and String variables.
* Task Objects (Output) - The list of output objects that match the criteria set in the activity. The output is returned from Orchestrator as a List<FormTaskData> object. Use this object to create a recovery workflow or to pass it as input to a different process.

Properties panel

Common

* ContinueOnError - Specifies if the automation should continue even when the activity throws an error. This field only supports Boolean values (True, False). The default value is False. As a result, if the field is blank and an error is thrown, the execution of the project stops. If the value is set to True, the execution of the project continues regardless of any error.

If this activity is included in Try Catch and the value of the ContinueOnError property is True, no error is caught when the project is executed.

* DisplayName - The display name of the activity.
* TimeoutMS - Specifies the amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait for the activity to run before an error is thrown. The default value is 30000 milliseconds (30 seconds).

Input

* Orchestrator Folder Path - The path to the Orchestrator Folder you want to use with this activity. If left empty, the current Orchestrator folder is used. This field supports only strings and String variables.
* Reference - The Action's reference that was set using the Create Form Task activity.
* Task Catalog Name - The action's catalog name that was set using the Create Form Task activity.

Misc

* Private - If selected, the values of variables and arguments are no longer logged at Verbose level.

# OData Query Examples

Use the following examples to get Form Tasks, or for inspiration for other
                    queries:Get the IDs of Form Tasks of High priority that are Pending, ordered by
                        their title in descending order.Filter: "((Priority eq 'High') and (Status eq
                                    'Pending'))"Order By: "Title desc"Select: "Id"Get the Action Catalog where all the Form Tasks that are Unassigned and of
                        Medium priority are stored in, and order them by their title in ascending
                            order.Filter: "((Priority eq 'Medium') and (Status eq
                                    'Unassigned'))"Order By: "Title asc"Select: "Id, TaskCatalogName"
