# Create Form Task

UiPath.Persistence.Activities.FormTask.CreateFormTask

# Description

Creates a form
                action in both cloud and on-premises instances of Action Center. It also creates a
                form task in On-Premises Orchestrator version 21.4 and lower.

Prerequisites

* Install the UiPath.FormActivityLibrary package version 2.0.7 or higher to enable the form designer.
* Form tasks have a limit of maximum 1MB. To fit in this 1MB limit, you need to embed images inside forms, using Storage Buckets only. Also, we suggest using images of type base64 only for logos and icons smaller than 2KB.

Designer panel

* TaskTitle - The title of the action you want to create. This field supports strings and String variables only.
* TaskPriority - Enables you to select the priority level of the action. By default, this property is set to TaskPriority.Medium The following options are available: TaskPriority.Low, TaskPriority.Medium, TaskPriority.High, TaskPriority.Critical.
* TaskCatalog - An optional business classification of task items. This field supports only strings and String variables.Make sure the action catalog exists prior to the action creation. Otherwise, action creation fails with the following error message: "No task catalog exists with name [action_catalog_name] Error code: 2451".
* FormData - A collection of business data in the form Dictionary<String,Argument> that you want to display in a form within the Actions inbox. Modifying Out and In/Out arguments maps them back to the workflow after the task is completed. This field supports Dictionary<String,Argument> objects only.
* TaskObject(Output) - The task object that is returned from Orchestrator as a FormTaskData object after the action is created. This object can be passed to the Wait for Form Task and Resume activity in order to suspend the execution of the workflow until the action is completed.

TaskObject
                has several attributes that hold information about the output action object. For
                example, the TaskUrl attribute gives you the URL to the action
                inside the Actions tab in Orchestrator On-Premises, while the
                    ActionUrl attribute gives you the URL to the action inside the
                    Actions tab in Automation Cloud. To access the action from the Action
                Center on-premises, add /actions_/tasks/taskID to the Action Center
                base URL, for example:
                    https://laptop-name:port-number/actions_/tasks/taskID.

Clicking the Open Form Designer button opens the Form Designer Wizard, which enables you to customize the
                form that you want to use in your workflow.

The Open Bulk Form Designer button becomes available when the Enable Bulk Edit
                property is selected. This option opens the Bulk Form Designer allowing you to design form actions
                that can be bulk edited or completed in the Actions tab of the corresponding
                Action Center instance.

Properties
                    panel

Common

* ContinueOnError - Specifies if the automation should continue even when the activity throws an error. This field only supports Boolean values (True, False). The default value is False. As a result, if the field is blank and an error is thrown, the execution of the project stops. If the value is set to True, the execution of the project continues regardless of any error.

If this activity
                is included in Try Catch and the value of the ContinueOnError property
                is True, no error is caught when the project is executed.

* DisplayName - The display name of the activity.
* TimeoutMS - Specifies the amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait for the activity to run before an error is thrown. The default value is 30000 milliseconds (30 seconds).

Input

* Enable Advanced Forms - enables enhanced features and customization options for form rendering and logic, such as:Customizable templates for Edit Grids.Buttons functioning as Events.The ability to customize forms using ES6 and modern JavaScript.The availability of the instance and options variables for customizing forms.
* Enable Bulk Edit - If selected, the Open Bulk Form Designer button becomes available in the body of the activity. This option allows you to generate form actions that can be bulk edited or completed from the Actions tab in Action Center.
* FormData - A collection of business data in the form Dictionary<String,Argument> that you want to display in a form within the Actions inbox. Modifying Out and In/Out arguments maps them back to the workflow after the task is completed. This field supports Dictionary<String,Argument> objects only.
* GenerateInputFields - If selected, all the entries from the Form Data Collection are generated as components in the Form Designer. Leaving it empty does not add additional form fields to the designer.
* Labels - The robot adds the inputted labels to the action, allowing future filtering. This field support string values only and has naming restrictions.

To allow automatic
                actions labeling through Persistence activities, the robot account executing the
                workflow needs View, Create, and Delete permissions on
                    Tags.

* Orchestrator Folder Path - The path to the Orchestrator Folder you want to use with this activity. If left empty, the current Orchestrator folder is used. This field supports only strings and String variables.

If the user
                performing this Action does not have the required permissions for the target folder,
                task creation fails and throws a critical error. View more info on Folder
                Permissions.

* Reference - The name used as reference for future filtering of the actions. This field supports string values only.
* TaskCatalog - An optional business classification of task items. This field supports only strings and String variables.Make sure the action catalog exists prior to the action creation. Otherwise, action creation fails with the following error message: "No task catalog exists with name [action_catalog_name] Error code: 2451".
* TaskPriority - Enables you to select the priority level of the action. By default, this property is set to TaskPriority.Medium The following options are available: TaskPriority.Low, TaskPriority.Medium, TaskPriority.High, TaskPriority.Critical.
* TaskTitle - The title of the action you want to create. This field supports strings and String variables only.
* Use Local Form File - enables the creation of Form Actions using a JSON form file, specified at execution. This field supports Boolean values only. When you enable it, the Form File Path property field appears in the body of the activity, where you specify the path to the JSON file, where a certain form layout is stored.After you select Use Local Form File, click Open Form Designer, select New, and start building a form. When you finish , select Save As, and save it inside the corresponding project folder. Now you have the form that you previously created stored inside a JSON file. Input the path to this JSON file inside the Form File Path field to use that form at runtime.

Misc

* Private - If selected, the values of variables and arguments are no longer logged at Verbose level.

Output

* TaskObject(Output) - The task object that is returned from Orchestrator as a FormTaskData object after the action is created. This object can be passed to the Wait for Form Task and Resume activity in order to suspend the execution of the workflow until the action is completed.

Storage

* Storage Bucket Name - The storage bucket you want to use for large data files referenced in the form data.
* Storage Folder Path - The full path to the folder in the specified storage bucket. This field supports strings and String variables only.Using image embedding with the Storage Buckets must be done in conjunction with the Upload Storage File activity. The argument name must be suffixed in the FormDataCollection property and mapped to an image in the form, by using underscore (_) in an HTML Element component.The argument name (<key>_storage) must be mapped to the storage value in the Destination property of the Upload Storage File activity.Note that image file names must not contain plus (+), as this character is masked by the storage bucket upload process resulting in an error.

# Known issue

The Form Designer might not automatically update when a new column is added to grid
                components. To address this, you can use the following workaround:

1. Open the Form Designer.
2. Edit any component within the form and then save the changes.
3. Save the entire form.
4. Reopen the form, undo the previous changes you made, and save it again.Now the form should be reset and the new columns should be visible.

### Designing form actions in Studio Web

This tutorial guides you through the process of designing
            form actions in Studio Web. After you add the Create Form
                Task activity to your Studio Web project, you will open the project in Studio
            Desktop to design your form actions.

In Studio Web, inside the Projects window, select See more and
                    then Open in Studio Desktop.After your project loads, install the FormActivityLibrary package to
                    enable the Form Designer.Now you can start designing your form actions. Select Open Form Designer in the Create Form Task activity, and
                    design your form actions.To save your form actions, in Studio Desktop, select Cloud Project, and
                    then Save to cloud. This saves your changes in Studio Web, so you can
                    resume your work from there.
