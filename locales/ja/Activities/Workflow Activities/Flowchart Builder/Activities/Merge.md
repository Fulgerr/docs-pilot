# Merge

Merge activities converge multiple process paths into a single path to continue the process execution. By default, it waits for all branches to complete before proceeding. You can change this behavior from the Properties panel, allowing the activity to wait for the first branch to complete before proceeding.

Split and Merge activities are recommended for workflows requiring concurrent tasks, such as gathering approvals from multiple departments or performing simultaneous data validation and enrichment.

The Merge activity corresponds to the Parallel Gateway, Inclusive Gateway, and Event Based Gateway elements in BPMN.
