# Process Tracking Service support

System activities support Process Tracking Service only when the automation containing them has the Process tracking option enabled.

When multiple automations are used to implement an end-to-end business process, two behaviors occur:

# Trace ID propagation

Trace ID propagation—when the trace ID of automation A1 propagates automatically to an automation A2. All tasks in automation A2 belong to the trace ID of the automation A1.

The following table summarizes the System activities that generate trace ID propagation:

ActivitiesTrace ID propagationJob-related activitiesStart JobOccurs when automation A1 triggers automation A2, the trace ID generated by automation A1 propagates automatically to automation A2. All tasks in automation A2 belong to the trace ID of the automation A1.Queue-related activitiesAdd Queue ItemAdd Transaction ItemOccurs when automation A1 creates a queue item QI-1 using the mentioned activities. The trace ID generated by automation A1 propagates automatically to the automation that processes the queue item QI-1.

# Task ID generation

Task generation—when automation A1 is suspended and waits for an external event to complete before resuming, such as a different automation to be fully executed, processing queue items, or waiting for an Action task to complete.

The following table summarizes the System activities that generate new task IDs:

ActivitiesTask ID generationTask name syntaxTask start and end timestampsQueue-related activitiesGet Transaction Item / Add Transaction Item + Set Transaction StatusGet Transaction Item / Add Transaction Item + Postpone Transaction ItemOccurs when automation A1 starts and processes a queue transaction.Automation A1 maps queue item statuses to task statuses:Successful queue item - Successful taskFailed queue item - Failed taskPostponed queue item - Cancelled task<ProcessName-QueueName>—combines the process name that processed the queue item and the queue name where the item is located.Task start timestam—when automation A1 starts processing the queue item.Task end timestamp—when automation A1 sets the queue item status or postpones the queue item.
