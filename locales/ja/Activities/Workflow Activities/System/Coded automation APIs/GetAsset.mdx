# GetAsset

Gets a specified Orchestrator asset by using a provided
                AssetName. If the asset is not global, it must be assigned to the local robot
            in order to be retrieved. The activity uses the same authentication context as the Robot
            under which it runs. For more information about global assets, you can access About Assets.
