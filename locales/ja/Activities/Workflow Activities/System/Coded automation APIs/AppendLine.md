textStringThe text to be appended to the file.file ILocalResourceThe path of the file to append the line to. If the path is not full, the
                        file is created in the project folder.useDefaultEncodingBooleanUse the default operating system encoding is used when a new file is created
                        or when the encoding cannot be detected. If not selected, the UTF-8 encoding
                        is used. encodingStringThe encoding type to be used. You can find the complete list of codes for
                        each character encoding here. If no encoding type is
                        specified, the activity will search for the file's Byte Order Marks to
                        detect the encoding. If no Byte Order Marks are detected and Use default
                            encoding is not used, UTF-8 will be used by default.
