# GetJobs

Retrieves a list of Orchestrator jobs according to a custom
            filter, using the Orchestrator API. You can also specify the number of jobs to skip
            and/or the maximum number of jobs to retrieve. Note that in order to execute this
            activity in Studio, the Robot has to be connected to Orchestrator and the Robot role needs the View right on
            jobs, processes, and environments. The activity runs under the Robot which executes
            it.
