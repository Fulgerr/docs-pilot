# GetTransactionItem

Gets an item from the Orchestrator queue so that you can process it (start the transaction) and sets its status to In Progress. Starting its processing makes it a transaction. Note that to execute this method, the Robot role needs to have Edit permissions on queues. The method runs under the Robot which executes it.

If the queue is empty, the following error is thrown upon accessing the retrieved TransactionItem: System.Exception: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.
