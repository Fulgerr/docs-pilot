Combines rows from two tables by using values common to each other, according to a Join
            rule, which is specified in the Join Type parameter.

DataTable JoinDataTables(

dataTable1DataTableThe first table that you want to use in the Join operation, stored in a
                            DataTable variable. dataTable2 DataTableThe second table that you want to use in the Join operation, stored in a
                            DataTable variable.The order in which the two tables are supplied
                            is very important, because it influences the structure of the resulting
                            table, according to the option selected in the JoinType property
                            field.argumentsList<JoinOperationArgument>The conditions to join the data tables by.If a column from DataTable2 shares the
                            same name with a column from DataTable1, then the name of the
                            column from DataTable2 is changed to
                                [ColumnName]_1 in the resulting table. If a column
                            with the [ColumnName]_1 name already exists, the
                            consecutive number that is not already in use is used instead. For
                            example, if DataTable1 has columns named ID, ID_1
                            and ID_2, and DataTable2 has a column named ID,
                            after the join, the column in DataTable2 is named
                            ID_3.joinTypeJoinType The type of Join operation you want to use. The following options are
                            available:Inner - Keep all rows from DataTable1
                                and DataTable2 which meet the Join rule. Any rows that do not
                                meet the rule are removed from the resulting table.Left - Keep all rows from DataTable1
                                and only the values from DataTable2 which meet the Join rule.
                                Null values are inserted into the column for the rows from
                                    DataTable1 that don't have a match in the
                                    DataTable2 rows.Full - Keep all rows from DataTable1
                                and DataTable2, regardless of whether the join condition is
                                met. Null values are added into the rows from both tables that don't
                                have a match.
