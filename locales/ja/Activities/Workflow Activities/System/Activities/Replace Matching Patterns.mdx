# Replace Matching Patterns

UiPath.Core.Activities.Replace

# Description

Within a specified input string, replaces strings that match a regular expression pattern with a specified replacement string. This activity has a RegEx Builder wizard that can be used to configure it, on which you can read more here.

# Cross-platform configuration

* Text to replace - The string to be replaced.

* Replacement with text - The replacement string.

Additional properties

* Pattern options - A bitwise combination of the enumeration values that specify options for matching.
* Result - A boolean variable that is set to true if the regular expression finds a match, and is set to false otherwise.

Common

* DisplayName - The display name of the activity.

Input

* Pattern - The regular expression pattern to match.
* Pattern options - A list of specific options for matching.
* Replace text - The replacement string.
* Text to replace - The string to be replaced.
* Timeout (ms) - The maximum duration, in milliseconds, that a pattern-matching operation can run before it is terminated. This property is essential for preventing the app from slowing down or freezing when processing complex or inefficient patterns. If the pattern match does not complete in the set time, an exception is thrown, ensuring the application remains responsive and safe from possible attacks that try to overload it.We highly recommend setting a timeout value, to improve application stability and security.

Misc

* Private - If selected, the values of variables and arguments are no longer logged at Verbose level.
* Result - A new string that is identical to the input string, except that a replacement string takes the place of each matched string.
