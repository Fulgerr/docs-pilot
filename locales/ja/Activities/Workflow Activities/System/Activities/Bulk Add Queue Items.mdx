# Bulk Add Queue Items

UiPath.Core.Activities.BulkAddQueueItems

# Description

Adds a collection of items from a specified DataTable to a specified queue in Orchestrator. Once added to the queue, the items' statuses are changed to New.

In order for the UiPath.Core.Activities.BulkAddQueueItems activity to work in a process, the Robot must be connected to Orchestrator. This is needed in order to send and retrieve information about queues, items and statuses.

* Orchestrator folder path - The path of the folder where the specified queue is located, if different from the folder where the process is running. This field only supports string values, with / as the separator to indicate subfolders. For example "Finance/Accounts Payable".The Orchestrator folder path parameter does not work for processes executed by robots in classic folders. Only robots in modern folders have the ability to pass data outside of their folder.Relative folder paths are supported in an X-UIPATH-FolderPath-Encoded header, as follows:Path starting with / - starts from the root folder of the tree the ambient folder is part of.Path starting with . - starts from the ambient folder.Path starting with .. - starts one level up in the hierarchy of the ambient folder for each .. in the path (e.g. ../ for one level up, ../../ for two levels up in the hierarchy).Note that trailing slashes are not accepted.
* QueueName - The name of the queue where you want to add the new queue items. This field supports only strings and String variables.
* DataTable - The DataTable variable that contains the values you want to add to the specified queue. This field supports only DataTable variables.This DataTable variable can also contain data about References, depending on how the columns of the file are mapped. You can also read more on References here.







Advanced options

Options

* CommitType - A drop-down which specifies the way the items are added to the queue, as well as the manner in which the errors are treated. The following options are available:AllOrNothing - The activity adds all of the specified queue items if no error occurs. In the case of an error, no items are added and the row where the error occurs is returned. ProcessAllIndependently - Adds each queue item individually and returns a list of all queue items that could not be added, if any.
* Timeout (milliseconds) - Specifies the amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait for the activity to run before an error is thrown. The default value is 30000 milliseconds (30 seconds).
* Continue on error - Specifies if the automation should continue even when the activity throws an error. This field only supports Boolean values (True, False). The default value is False. As a result, if the field is not configured and an error is thrown, the execution of the project stops. If the value is set to True, the execution of the project continues regardless of any error.If this activity is included in Try Catch and the value of the Continue on error property is True, no error is caught when the project is executed.

Output

* Result - Depending on the selection made in the CommitType property, returns all errors that occurred during the process, storing them in a DataTable variable. This field supports only DataTable variables.

* Continue On Error - Specifies if the automation should continue even when the activity throws an error. This field only supports Boolean values (True, False). The default value is False. As a result, if the field is blank and an error is thrown, the execution of the project stops. If the value is set to True, the execution of the project continues regardless of any error.If this activity is included in Try Catch and the value of the Continue On Error property is True, no error is caught when the project is executed.
* DisplayName - The display name of the activity.
* Timeout (milliseconds) - Specifies the amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait for the activity to run before an error is thrown. The default value is 30000 milliseconds (30 seconds).

* DataTable - The DataTable variable that contains the values you want to add to the specified queue. This field supports only DataTable variables.Please note that a maximum of 15000 lines are accepted by the UiPath Orchestrator. If this limit is reached, an error will be thrown.This DataTable variable can also contain data about References, depending on how the columns of the file are mapped.
