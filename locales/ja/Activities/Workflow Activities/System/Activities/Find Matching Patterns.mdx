# Find Matching Patterns

UiPath.Core.Activities.Matches

# Description

Searches an input string for all occurrences of a regular expression and returns all the successful matches. This activity has a RegEx Builder wizard that can be used to configure it, on which you can read more here.

This activity does not work well in workflows using persistence.

# Project compatibility

Windows - Legacy | Windows | Cross-platform

# Cross-platform configuration

* Text to search in - The string to be searched for matches.
* Pattern - The regular expression pattern to match.

Additional properties

Input

* Pattern Options - A bitwise combination of the enumeration values that specify options for matching. The available options are IgnoreCase, Multiline, ExplicitCapture, Compiled, Singeline, IgnorePatternWhitespace, RightToLeft, ECMAScript, and CultureInvariant.

Output

* Result - Reference to the collection of found matches.
* First Match - Outputs the first match as String.

* DisplayName - The display name of the activity.

Input

* Pattern - The regular expression pattern to match.
* Pattern options - A bitwise combination of the enumeration values that specify options for matching.
* Text to search in - The string to be searched for matches.
* Timeout (ms) - The maximum duration, in milliseconds, that a pattern-matching operation can run before it is terminated. This property is essential for preventing the app from slowing down or freezing when processing complex or inefficient patterns. If the pattern match does not complete in the set time, an exception is thrown, ensuring the application remains responsive and safe from possible attacks that try to overload it.We highly recommend setting a timeout value, to improve application stability and security.

Misc

* Private - If selected, the values of variables and arguments are no longer logged at Verbose level.
* Result - Reference to the collection of found matches.

Output

* First Match - Outputs the first match as String.

# Example of using the Matches activity

Here you can see how the Matches activity is used in an example that incorporates multiple activities.
