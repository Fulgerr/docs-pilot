# Add Transaction Item

UiPath.Core.Activities.AddTransactionItem

# Description

Adds a new item in the queue and starts a transaction. The status of the item is set to InProgress. Returns the item as a QueueItem variable.

For the UiPath.Core.Activities.AddTransactionItem activity to work in a process, the Robot must be connected to Orchestrator. This is needed in order to send and retrieve information about queues, items and statuses.

* Orchestrator folder path - The path of the folder where specified queue is located, if different from the folder where the process is running. This field only supports string values, with / as the separator to indicate subfolders. For example "Finance/Accounts Payable".The Orchestrator folder path parameter does not work for processes executed by robots in classic folders. Only robots in modern folders have the ability to pass data outside of their folder.Relative folder paths are supported in an X-UIPATH-FolderPath-Encoded header, as follows:Path starting with / - starts from the root folder of the tree the ambient folder is part of.Path starting with . - starts from the ambient folder.Path starting with .. - starts one level up in the hierarchy of the ambient folder for each .. in the path (e.g. ../ for one level up, ../../ for two levels up in the hierarchy).Note that trailing slashes are not accepted.
* Queue Name - The queue where the QueueItem object is to be added. The name is case insensitive, meaning that if in Orchestrator it was defined as "MyFirstQueue", it matches "myfirstqueue".







Advanced options

Input

* Reference - The reference of the added QueueItem.
* Transaction Information - A collection of additional information about the specific TransactionItem that is to be added. The information is stored in the item and is used during a transaction processing.The value of string arguments cannot contain the following characters: [ and " ". Argument names cannot contain the following characters: :, ., ,, @, ".

Misc

* Timeout (milliseconds) - Specifies the amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait for the activity to run before an error is thrown. The default value is 30000 milliseconds (30 seconds).
* Continue on error - Specifies if the automation should continue even when the activity throws an error. This field only supports Boolean values (True, False). The default value is False. As a result, if the field is not configured and an error is thrown, the execution of the project stops. If the value is set to True, the execution of the project continues regardless of any error.If this activity is included in Try Catch and the value of the Continue on error property is true, no error is caught when the project is executed.

Output

* Continue On Error - Specifies if the automation should continue even when the activity throws an error. This field only supports Boolean values (True, False). The default value is False. As a result, if the field is blank and an error is thrown, the execution of the project stops. If the value is set to True, the execution of the project continues regardless of any error.If this activity is included in Try Catch and the value of the ContinueOnError property is true, no error is caught when the project is executed.
* DisplayName - The display name of the activity.
* Timeout (milliseconds) - Specifies the amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait for the activity to run before an error is thrown. The default value is 30000 milliseconds (30 seconds).
