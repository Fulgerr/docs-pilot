# Upload Storage File

UiPath.Core.Activities.Storage.UploadStorageFile

# Description

Uploads a file to a specified Storage Bucket in Orchestrator.

# Project compatibility

Windows - Legacy | Windows | Cross-platform

# Cross-platform configuration

* Orchestrator folder path—The path to the Orchestrator Folder you want to use with this activity. If left empty, the current Orchestrator folder is used. This field supports only strings and String variables. Use / as a subfolder separator to specify the desired folder.
* Storage Bucket Name—The name of the Storage Bucket where you want to upload the file. This field is mandatory. This field supports only strings and String variables.
* File—The full path of the file you want to upload to the mentioned Storage Bucket. You can use toggle between using a local path or a variable of IResource type. If you are using a local path, relative folder paths are recommended to account for the different file structure between Windows and Linux machines when executing a project. Example: newFolder/newFileName.txt.
* Where to upload—The path where you want to upload the file in the Storage Bucket.





Advanced options

Others

* Timeout (milliseconds)—Specifies the amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait for the activity to run before an error is thrown. The default value is 30000 milliseconds (30 seconds).
* Continue On Error—Specifies if the automation should continue even when the activity throws an error. This field only supports Boolean values (True, False). The default value is False. As a result, if the field is blank and an error is thrown, the execution of the project stops. If the value is set to True, the execution of the project continues regardless of any error.If this activity is included in Try Catch and the value of the Continue On Error property is True, no error is caught when the project is executed.

# Windows - Legacy, Windows configuration

Destination—The path where you want to upload the file in the Storage Bucket. Use \ as a directory separator to specify the desired destination directory. If the destination file already exists, it is overwritten. This field supports only strings and String variables.File—The full path of the file you want to upload to the Storage bucket indicated in the Storage Bucket Name field. This field supports variables of the IResource type. Use this field when the file is dynamically obtained during execution, such as an attachment from an email.Path —The full local path to the file you want to upload to the specified Storage Bucket. Relative paths are resolved based on the runtime execution directory. This field supports only strings and String variables. Use this field when the file is located in the project folder.Storage Bucket Name—The name of the Storage Bucket where you want to upload the file. This field is mandatory. This field supports only strings and String variables.You must use one of these fields, as they are mutually exclusive. When specifying a local path, always use relative folder paths to ensure compatibility across different file structures on Windows and Linux systems. For example: newFolder/newFileName.txt.Properties panel
