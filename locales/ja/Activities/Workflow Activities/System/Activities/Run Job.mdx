# Description

Use the Run Job activity to easily start other automations such as RPA workflows or Agent processes. This single activity consolidates existing activities that start automations from your workflow. You can select what type of project you want to start, and the activity adapts its behavior based on your selection.

Selected automation must exist in your Orchestrator folder prior to configuring this activity.After updating an automation, make sure you republish it and redeploy the corresponding process to the Orchestrator folder.

* Activity body properties:Orchestrator folder pathSelect the Orchestrator folder where the automation you want to start from within your worfklow is deployed. Only the folders you can access are displayed in the dropdown menu. If you do not select an option, your Personal Workspace is used.Process nameSelect the process associated to the automation you want to run. All types of processes are displayed: RPA, Agents, Agentic Orchestration. If the process you need is not listed, select Manage processes to be redirected to your folder in Orchestrator, where you can add the missing process.Input argumentsIf the selected process requires input arguments, you can configure them using this field.For the best experience, make sure you are using the latest Studio version (2025.0.161). Studio versions previous to 2025.0.161 use the Expression Editor window.The following code snippet show you how to provide values to agent input arguments using VB.NET and C#:'VB.NET New Email_Rewriter_Input() With { .feedback = "sample feedback", .originalEmail = "sample email content" }//C# new Email_Rewriter_Input { feedback = "sample feedback", originalEmail = "sample email content" }



* Properties panel:Execution modeSelect how the activity waits for the job to complete. The following options are available: Do not waitThe activity starts the job and allows the workflow to continue without waiting for the job to complete.Wait for job completionDefault option. The activity pauses the workflow until the started job finishes or the timeout is reached. If the job completion is succcesful, the activity returns the outputs, and the workflow resumes.Suspend execution until job completionThe activity pauses the workflow and awaits for output with persistence.TimeoutSets the maximum time to wait for job completion. Default value is 600,000 milliseconds (10 minutes).Continue on errorSpecify if the automation should continue even when the activity throws an error. This field only supports Boolean values (true, false). The default value is false. As a result, if the field is not configured and an error is thrown, the execution of the project stops. If the value is set to true, the execution of the project continues regardless of any error.Job dataDisplays the object of the started job. Generated automatically.Output argumentsDisplays the list of output arguments for the process, as they were defined during the process creation.If you select the process from a process list, the output object contains all the output properties of the selected process.If you provided the process using an expression, or if your execution mode returns values, you must configure input and output arguments using the Use Static Names option.
