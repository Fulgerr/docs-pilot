# Keypress Event Trigger

UiPath.UIAutomationNext.Activities.NKeyboardTrigger

# 

Sets up a key pressed event trigger on the indicated UI element.



The trigger must be the first activity in the workflow and the workflow is triggered
                when a certain UI event occurs. Only one trigger per workflow is allowed. For more
                details, check out Trigger-based Attended Automation.

If you are using a Studio version lower than 2023.4, you need to place the Application Event
                        Trigger activity inside a Trigger Scope activity. In this case,
                    the Keypress Event Trigger activity does not display the Scheduling
                        mode and Enabled properties and the Scheduling mode
                    property is available in the Trigger Scope activity.
