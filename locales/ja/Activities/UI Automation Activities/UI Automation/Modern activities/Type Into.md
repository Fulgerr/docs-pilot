# Type Into

UiPath.UIAutomationNext.Activities.NTypeInto

# 

Enters text in a specified UI element, for example a text box.

You can also send special keys like Tab or Enter to the UI element.

Sticky keys are also supported. For example, if you want to type
                    Shift+End to select only part of the text of a
                control, you need to select Shift and End from the
                list of special keys and the proposed text is [k(Shift)][k(End)].
                This emulates the Shift and End key presses
                sequentially. The correct text is [d(Shift)][k(End)][u(Shift)],
                where d stands for key down, k stands for key
                press, and u stands for key up.

If you want to enter sensitive information securely, add a Get Username/Password activity before this
                activity and select the saved for later username and password values from that
                activity as the text to type.

Single line (End, Shift+Home, Del) - Delete the content from a text field with a single line. This is the default option. Multi line (Ctrl+A, Del) - Delete the content from a text field with multiple lines.To use the activity to clear the indicated text field, configure this property to delete the existing content, leave the Type this field empty, and set the Input Mode property to Hardware Events.

This feature can be enabled from the Project Settings, or from the body of the activity, by selecting Add Auto-Verification from the context menu.Expected text - The text that is expected to be typed in the specified text field.
