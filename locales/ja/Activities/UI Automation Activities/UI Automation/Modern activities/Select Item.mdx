# Select Item

UiPath.UIAutomationNext.Activities.NSelectItem

# 

Selects an item from a drop-down combo box or list box. After you indicate the element on screen,
                the list with all the available options is displayed in the activity.

The activity does not detect non-native drop-down elements for web pages.







Using this activity on a combo box or
                list box that has not been interacted with before you run the workflow can cause the
                activity to throw an error. The best practice to avoid this issue is to add a Click activity configured to click
                the target drop-down menu before the Select Item activity is
                executed.
