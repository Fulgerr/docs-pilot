                                        debugger APIs. Works for Chromium elements only. Sends all
                                        text in one go. Works even if the target application is not
                                        in focus. For more details, check out this page.WindowMessages - Sends the input
                                        through Win32 messages. Recommended for desktop apps.
                                        Usually more reliable than Hardware Events. Sends all text
                                        in a single action. Works even if target app is not in
                                        focus. Please test if your target application UI element
                                        supports this
