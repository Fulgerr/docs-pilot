* FileName - The full file path where you can find the executable file of the application you want to open. For example, if you want to open Excel, the path should look like C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\root\Office16\EXCEL.EXE.
* Arguments - The parameters that can be passed to the application at startup. You can use this property to open a specific file with the application you want to open. For example, if you want to open a specific Excel workbook, you can add its full path in this property field. The path should look like C:\Users\currentuser\Documents\Sample.xlsxIf the file you want to open contains spaces in its name, you have to write the path between two sets of quotation marks. For example, if the file is named Sample file.xlsx, the path should look like ""C:\Users\currentuser\Documents\Sample file.xlsx"".
