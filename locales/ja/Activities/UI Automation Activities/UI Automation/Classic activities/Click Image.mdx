# Click Image

UiPath.Core.Activities.ClickImage

Searches for an image inside a UI element and clicks it.

The Double Click
                    Image activity has the same functionality as the Click Image
                activity, the only difference is that for the Double Click Image activity,
                the ClickType is set by default on CLICK_DOUBLE, while for the
                    Click Image activity, the ClickType is set by default on
                    CLICK_SINGLE.

# Properties

Common

* ContinueOnError - Specifies if the automation should continue even when the activity throws an error. This field only supports Boolean values (True, False). The default value is False. As a result, if the field is blank and an error is thrown, the execution of the project stops. If the value is set to True, the execution of the project continues regardless of any error.If this activity is included in Try Catch and the value of the ContinueOnError property is True, no error is caught when the project is executed.
* DelayAfter - Delay time (in milliseconds) after executing the activity. The default amount of time is 300 milliseconds.
* DelayBefore - Delay time (in milliseconds) before the activity begins performing any operations. The default amount of time is 200 milliseconds.
* DisplayName - The display name of the activity.

Input

* ClickType - Specifies the type of mouse click (single, double, up, down) used when simulating the click event.
* Image.Accuracy - A unit of measurement from 0 to 1 which expresses the minimum similarity between the image you are searching for and the one to be found. Useful in situations when the image to be found is slightly different than the one you are searching for. The default value is 0.8.
* Image.Image - An existing image to be searched for. This field supports only Image variables.
* Image.Profile - Enables you to change the image detection algorithm that you want to use. Basic is the classical algorithm, which has average speed and resource cost. Enhanced can offer more precise results, at the expense of more resources. By default, this field is set to Basic.
* MouseButton - The mouse button (left, right, middle) used for the click action. By default, the left mouse button is selected.
* Target.ClippingRegion - Defines the clipping rectangle, in pixels, relative to the UiElement, in the following directions: left, top, right, bottom. It supports both positive and negative numbers.
* Target.Element - Use the UiElement variable returned by another activity. This property cannot be used alongside the Selector property. This field supports only UiElement variables.
* Target.Selector - Text property used to find a particular UI element when the activity is executed. It is actually a XML fragment specifying attributes of the GUI element you are looking for and of some of its parents.
* Target.Timeout (milliseconds) - Specifies the amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait for the activity to run before the SelectorNotFoundException error is thrown. The default value is 30000 milliseconds (30 seconds).
* Target.WaitForReady - Before performing the actions, wait for the target to become ready. By default, Interactive/Complete is selected. The following options are available:None - Does not wait for anything except the target UI element to exist before executing the action. For example, you can use this option if you want to retrieve just text from a web page or click a particular button, without having to wait for all UI elements to load. Note that this may have unwanted consequences if the button relies on elements which are not yet loaded, such as scripts.Interactive - Waits until only a part of the app is loaded.Complete - Waits for the entire app to be loaded.

Misc

* Private - If selected, the values of variables and arguments are no longer logged at Verbose level.

Options

* CursorPosition.OffsetX - Horizontal displacement of the cursor position according to the option selected in the Position field.
* CursorPosition.OffsetY - Vertical displacement of the cursor position according to the option selected in the Position field.
* CursorPosition.Position - Describes the starting point of the cursor to which offsets from OffsetX and OffsetY properties are added. The following options are available: TopLeft, TopRight, BottomLeft, BottomRight and Center. The default option is Center.
* KeyModifiers - Enables you to add a key modifier. The following options are available: None, Alt, Ctrl, Shift, Win. The default option is None.KeyModifiers cannot be used with the SendWindowMessages option. No error is thrown when executing a workflow that contains an activity with this combination of options.
* SendWindowMessages - If this check box is selected, the click is executed by sending a specific message to the target application. This input method is faster and works in the background. By default, this check box is not selected. If the check box is not selected, the default method performs the click by using the hardware driver. The default method is the slowest, it cannot work in the background, but is compatible with all desktop apps.

# Example of using the Click Image and
                Double Click Image activities

You can see how the Click Image and
                    Double Click Image activities are used in an example that incorporates
                multiple activities.
