* ApiKey - The API key used to provide you access to the Microsoft Cloud OCR.

Options

* Language - The language used by the OCR engine to extract the text from the UI element or image. The language name must be fully written, such as "english", "japanese", "romanian". The Microsoft OCR engine uses the languages installed on your system.
* ExtractWords - If this checkbox is selected, the on-screen position of each detected word is extracted.
* Scale - The scaling factor of the selected UI element or image. The higher the number is, the more you enlarge the image. This can provide a better OCR read and it is recommended with small images. If you want to scale down, values between 0 and 1 are also accepted. By default, the value is 1.
