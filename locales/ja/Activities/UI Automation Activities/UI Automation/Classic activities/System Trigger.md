# Description

Monitors a specified system-wide key and/or mouse event.

It can be used either inside a Trigger Scope activity or by itself within
                a trigger workflow. When used by itself, the activity has one more property in the
                Properties panel, namely Enabled.

# Properties

* TriggerInput - Specifies the system-wide action to monitor. The following options are available: Mouse, Keyboard. Mouse and Keyboard can both be selected simultaneously.

MiscEnabled - If set to False, the trigger starts but does not
                        fire any events. It can be enabled later at runtime by using the Enable
                            Local Trigger activity. This field supports only Boolean
                        values. The default value is True.
