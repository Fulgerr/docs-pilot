Scope: Project

Default action: Info

This rule applies to activities that are part of both the Classic and the Modern UI
            Automation experiences.

# Description

Lists all the activities that have the ContinueOnError property set to True. When this property is set to True, all errors that occur during the execution of the activity are ignored, which is why we have implemented a rule to easier keep track of affected activities.
