# UI-DBP-013 - Excel Automation Misuse

Rule ID:UI-DBP-013

Scope: Activity

Default action: Warning

This rule applies to activities that are part of both the Classic
                                                and the Modern UI Automation experiences.

# Description

Checks if there are any UI Automation activities used to automate Excel. We recommend using the
                Excel activity package when automating in Excel, as those activities are especially
                designed to work with Microsoft Excel and have a far greater chance of success when
                performing complex tasks.
