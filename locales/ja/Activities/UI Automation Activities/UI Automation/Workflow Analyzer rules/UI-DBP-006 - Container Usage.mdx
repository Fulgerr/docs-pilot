# UI-DBP-006 - Container Usage

Rule ID:UI-DBP-006

Scope: Workflow

Default action: Error

This rule applies only to activities that are part of the Classic UI Automation
            experience.

# Description

Checks if consecutive activities in your automation are using
                the same top level selectors instead of using a container with a single selector. We
                recommend as a best practice to use scopes, such as  or , when performing
                multiple actions on the same UI element, as this method is more reliable instead of
                targeting each activity on the same selector.
