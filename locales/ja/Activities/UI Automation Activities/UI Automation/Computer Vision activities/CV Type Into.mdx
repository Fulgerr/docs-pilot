# CV Type Into

UiPath.CV.Activities.CVTypeIntoWithDescriptor

# 

Sends keystrokes to a UI element. Special keys are supported and can be selected from
                the drop-down list. The UI element is identified by using the UiPath Computer Vision
                neural network.

Common

* ContinueOnError - Specifies if the automation should continue even when the activity throws an error. This field only supports Boolean values (True, False). The default value is False. As a result, if the field is blank and an error is thrown, the execution of the project stops. If the value is set to True, the execution of the project continues regardless of any error.If this activity is included in Try Catch and the value of the ContinueOnError property is True, no error is caught when the project is executed.
* DelayAfter - Delay time (in milliseconds) after executing the activity.
* DelayBefore - Delay time (in milliseconds) before the activity begins performing any operations.
* DisplayName - The display name of the activity.

Input

* Descriptor - The on-screen coordinates of the Target and each Anchor that is used, if any. These values are stored in a CvDescriptor proprietary object. Once the Indicate On Screen feature is used at runtime, the CvDescriptor is automatically generated in this field and has the following structure:"Target: Image (14,61,105,54) OffsetPoint: (-10,-75)" + "Anchor: Text 'Anchor1' (41,36,19,9)" + "Anchor: Text 'Anchor2' (75,36,37,9)" +
* Text - The text to be written in the specified UI element. Special keys are supported, and you can select them from the activity's drop-down list.
* TimeoutMS - Specifies the amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait for the activity to run before an error is thrown. The default value is 30000 milliseconds (30 seconds).

Misc

* Private - If selected, the values of variables and arguments are no longer logged at Verbose level.

Options

* Activate - When this check box is selected, the specified UI element is brought to the foreground and activated before the text is written.If the Activate check box is not selected, the activity will type into the currently active window.
* ClickBeforeTyping - When this check box is selected, the specified UI element is clicked before the text is written.
* DelayBetweenKeys - Delay time (in milliseconds) between two keystrokes. The default amount of time is 10 milliseconds. The maximum value is 1000 milliseconds.
* EmptyField - When this check box is selected, all previously-existing content in the UI element is erased before writing your text.In Web environments, fields are emptied by default.

Reusable Region

* InputRegion - Receives the target of another CV activity stored in a Rectangle variable, using it as a target for this activity. This enables you to pass the same target from one activity to another. Especially useful at design time, as it makes performing multiple actions on the same UI element easier. If a variable is set to this field, the current target and anchor elements of the activity are disabled. This field supports only Rectangle variables.
* OutputRegion - Saves the target of this activity as a Rectangle variable. This enables you to pass the same target from one activity to another. Especially useful at design time, as it makes performing multiple actions on the same UI element easier.

Scroll

You can work with information stored in scrollable elements, such as lists, by selecting
                        Refresh with Delay during the indication process and then scrolling
                    up or down to reveal the elements you want to interact with.The properties in this section are only taken into account if you have scrolled in this method while indicating.

* DelayScreenshotAfterScroll - Defines the amount of time, in milliseconds, that the robot waits after scrolling and before refreshing the screen. Useful for automating applications or pages with dynamically loading UI elements.
* NumberOfScrolls - The number of scrolls that are performed between each screenshot at run-time, while searching for the target element.
* ScrollDirection - Specifies in which direction the scroll is performed at runtime, while searching for the target element. It can be Up, Down or None, depending on the direction we detected while indicating. If ScrollDirection is None, no scrolling is performed at run-time.
