# CV Get Text

UiPath.CV.Activities.CVGetTextWithDescriptor

# 

Extracts the text from a specified UI element. A drop-down menu in the body of the
                activity enables you to quickly select the method you want to use to retrieve the
                target text. Choosing an option in this drop-down modifies the Method
                property.

Common

* ContinueOnError - Specifies if the automation should continue even when the activity throws an error. This field only supports Boolean values (True, False). The default value is False. As a result, if the field is blank and an error is thrown, the execution of the project stops. If the value is set to True, the execution of the project continues regardless of any error.If this activity is included in Try Catch and the value of the ContinueOnError property is True, no error is caught when the project is executed.
* DelayAfter - Delay time (in milliseconds) after executing the activity.
* DelayBefore - Delay time (in milliseconds) before the activity begins performing any operations.
* DisplayName - The display name of the activity.

Input

* Descriptor - The on-screen coordinates of the Target and each Anchor that is used, if any. These values are stored in a CvDescriptor proprietary object. Once the Indicate On Screen feature is used at runtime, the CvDescriptor is automatically generated in this field and has the following structure:"Target: Image (14,61,105,54) OffsetPoint: (-10,-75)" + "Anchor: Text 'Anchor1' (41,36,19,9)" + "Anchor: Text 'Anchor2' (75,36,37,9)" +
* Method - Specifies what method you want to use to retrieve the text. The following options are available:OCR - Uses the OCR engine specified in the parent CV Screen Scope activity to retrieve the text. Select - all - Copies the entire text by using the clipboard. This simulates a copy/paste action and can only be used on selectable text, on either local or remote sessions. Select - row - Copies the text in the entire row by using the clipboard. This simulates a copy/paste action and can only be used on selectable text, on either local or remote sessions.
* TimeoutMS - Specifies the amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait for the activity to run before an error is thrown. The default value is 30000 milliseconds (30 seconds).

Misc

* Private - If selected, the values of variables and arguments are no longer logged at Verbose level.

Options

* RefreshBefore - If selected, a Computer Vision screen analysis is carried out to make sure that any changes in the user interface since the last CV Screen Scope or Refresh activities are captured. By default, this check box is selected.

Output

* Result - The retrieved text, stored in a String variable. This field supports only String variables.

Reusable Region

* InputRegion - Receives the target of another CV activity stored in a Rectangle variable, using it as a target for this activity. This enables you to pass the same target from one activity to another. Especially useful at design time, as it makes performing multiple actions on the same UI element easier. If a variable is set to this field, the current target and anchor elements of the activity are disabled. This field supports only Rectangle variables.
* OutputRegion - Saves the target of this activity as a Rectangle variable. This enables you to pass the same target from one activity to another. Especially useful at design time, as it makes performing multiple actions on the same UI element easier.

Scroll

You can work with information stored in scrollable elements, such as lists, by selecting
                        Refresh with Delay during the indication process and then scrolling
                    up or down to reveal the elements you want to interact with.The properties in this section are only taken into account if you have scrolled in this method while indicating.

* Content Scroll Offset - Scroll Offset used in scrolling to extract the content.
* DelayScreenshotAfterScroll - Defines the amount of time, in milliseconds, that the robot waits after scrolling and before refreshing the screen. Useful for automating applications or pages with dynamically loading UI elements.
* NumberOfScrolls - The number of scrolls that are performed between each screenshot at run-time, while searching for the target element.
* ScrollableContent - Specifies if the text area should be scrolled down.
* ScrollDirection - Specifies in which direction the scroll is performed at runtime, while searching for the target element. It can be Up, Down or None, depending on the direction we detected while indicating. If ScrollDirection is None, no scrolling is performed at run-time.
