# Accessibility issues in DevExpress applications

# Description

For an application that uses the DevExpress WinForms Tree List, Tree List nodes that
                were initially outside of the visible viewport are not recognized as tree nodes by
                accessibility clients.

The automation for this target application worked until the DevExpress framework was
                updated to version 23.2.4. Only the elements from the initial table view are
                available. Even if we scroll, we cannot find any of the new elements coming into the
                view.

# Cause

DevExpress framework bug for versions 23.2.4 and 23.2.5: Tree List nodes that were initially outside of
                    the visible viewport are not recognized as tree nodes by accessibility
                    clients.

# Solution

The DevExpress team addressed the issue in the Bug Report T1226485 and a hotfix was
                released in versions: 23.2.6, 24.1.3. Applying the hotfix resolves the problem.

Until the release of the hotfix, the workaround was to provide the customer with a
                library that can be used to enable UI Automation support in DevExpress, by using the
                    Inject .NET Code activity.
