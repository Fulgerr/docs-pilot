# Enable UI Automation support in DevExpress

# Untitled Section

To enable UI Automation support in DevExpress, you need to follow these steps:

1. Use this link to download the DevExpressFix.zip file and then:Build the DevExpressFix.dll file from the project using the C# project from the archive, orUse the DLL file already built, which is also available in the .zip file (DevExpressFix\bin\Release\DevExpressFix.dll).
2. Add an Inject .NET Code activity to the workflow, that should inject and execute the .NET library code in the context of the target application built on top of the DevExpress framework.
3. Under the Assembly property, enter the full path to the DevExpressFix.dll file.
4. Under the Type Name property, enter "DevExpressFix.DevExpressActivateUIAutomation".
5. Under the Method Name property, enter "TryFixDevExpressUIA".

Once this function gets executed through the Inject .NET Code activity into the
                application built on top of the DevExpress framework, it activates UI Automation
                support, and you can use reliable selectors with UI Automation.The Inject .NET Code activity can be used on .NET
                    UI applications that do not expose traditional automation technologies (Active
                    Accessibility – AA, UI Automation - UIA) or when such technologies are exposed
                    but fail to achieve the desired result. It has been tested (but it is not
                    limited) on WPF and WinForms Windows applications.
