# Check App State

UiPath.UIAutomationNext.Activities.NCheckState

# 

Checks the state of an application or web browser by verifying if an element appears
                in or disappears from the user interface, and can execute one set of activities if
                the element is found and a different set of activities if the element is not found.

It can monitor an entire application for changes, not only a single UI element.



It can also be used as a condition for the Retry Scope activity.
