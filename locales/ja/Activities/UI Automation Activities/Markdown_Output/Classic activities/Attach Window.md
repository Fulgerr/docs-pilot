# Attach Window

UiPath.Core.Activities.WindowScope

A container that enables you to attach to an already opened window and perform multiple actions within it. This activity is also automatically generated when using the Desktop recorder.

# Properties

Input

* Selector - Text property used to find a particular UI element when the activity is executed. It is actually a XML fragment specifying attributes of the GUI element you are looking for and of some of its parents. If both this property and the Window property are configured, the Selector property is used at design time, and the Window property is used at runtime.
* Window - The window to attach to. This field accepts only Window variables. If both this property and the Selector property are configured, the Selector property is used at design time, and the Window property is used at runtime.

Options

* SearchScope - The application window in which to search for the UI element defined by the Selector property.

Common

* DisplayName - The display name of the activity.
* TimeoutMS - Specifies the amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait for the activity to run before an error is thrown. The default value is 30000 milliseconds (30 seconds).
* ContinueOnError - Specifies if the automation should continue even when the activity throws an error. This field only supports Boolean values (True, False). The default value is False. As a result, if the field is blank and an error is thrown, the execution of the project stops. If the value is set to True, the execution of the project continues regardless of any error.If this activity is included in Try Catch and the value of the ContinueOnError property is True, no error is caught when the project is executed.

Output

* ApplicationWindow - The found active window. This field supports only Window variables. When a Window variable is specified, SearchScope and Selector properties are ignored.

Misc

* Private - If selected, the values of variables and arguments are no longer logged at Verbose level.
