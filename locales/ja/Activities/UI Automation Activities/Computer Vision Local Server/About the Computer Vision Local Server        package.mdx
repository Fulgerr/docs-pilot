# About the Computer Vision Local Server
        package

The UiPath.ComputerVision.LocalServer package contains no activities,
            but once installed in a project, enables you to use a local Computer Vision server. It
            can be installed via the Package Manager in Studio.

The local Computer Vision model is on par feature wise with the current server model. There are
                small differences between these versions of the model, such as:Computer Vision Local Server
                    enables you to use Computer Vision directly on the machine it is installed on,
                    without requiring other external resources, such as a separate Server Machine or
                    a powerful GPU, etc.The Local Server is slower than
                    the other available types of servers.All data used by this version of
                    the model is processed locally, on the machine you have it installed on. No data
                    is sent outside of your machine to be processed.Costs associated with this
                    version of the model are considerably lower, as the hardware and maintenance
                    requirements are null compared to the on-premises server version.The model can process up to 2000
                    words per request. If a request exceeds this limit, the model still returns 2000
                    words, but with no guaranteed order.Up until v21.6, the Computer
                    Vision Local Server does not support OCR.Up until v22.7, the Computer
                    Vision Local Server does not support Table Extraction.

Recommended hardware specifications

You need a machine with the following hardware specifications:

* a CPU with minimum 4 cores; the
                performance scales with multiple CPUs, so 8 cores would be even better, however,
                please note that scaling above 16 cores would have diminishing returns with little
                to no speedup
* AVX2 support; CPUs without AVX2
                instructions are not supported and an error is thrown if they are used
* minimum 8 GB of RAM

When should this server version be used?

* When you cannot use the Computer
                Vision Cloud server or the Computer Vision on-premises server.
* When, due to security concerns, you
                do not want any data leaving the machine you are running the automation process on.
* When you cannot install additional
                software on the machine you want to use, as this version does not require additional
                installation on the machine, it can simply be installed from Studio, via the Package
                Manager.

How do you use this server?

Install the UiPath.ComputerVision.LocalServer package in your Studio Project by
            using the Package Manager.

Once this package is installed, the CV Screen Scope activity can be
            configured via the UseLocalServer property to use this local server.

You can also use Computer Vision Local Server if you set Use Local Server to
                True in Project Settings > Computer Vision. When Local Server
            is enabled, the server value is over-written.

Computer Vision Local Server is not available in cross-platform projects.

# Troubleshooting

To run
                correctly, UiPath.ComputerVision.LocalServer needs the Visual C++ Redistributables
                for 2015-2019 for both x64 and x86 systems installed on the operating system where
                you want to use it. You can find the latest versions here.

If
                you're using the UiPath.ComputerVision.LocalServer package and you're encountering a
                    Response from server is not valid error, the most probable
                explanation is that the local server executable is being blocked by an antivirus
                software. Please check that

UiPath.CVLocalServer.Host.exe
                from
                    CurrentUser\.nuget\packages\uipath.computervision.localserver\20.10.0\lib\net461
                (for version 20.10) or
                    CurrentUser\.nuget\packages\uipath.computervision.localserver\USED_VERSION\build
                (for version 21.2 and up) is trusted by the antivirus software you are
            using.
