# Get Field

UiPath.Terminal.Activities.TerminalGetField

# Description

Gets the text from a specified form field and stores it into a
                    String variable. The form field is designated by using
                selectors.

The activity is valid only inside a Terminal Session activity.

This activity fails if
                the VT family of terminals is being used, either with the Direct Connection provider
                or with a provider using a 3rd party terminal emulator, like IBM EHLLAPI. This
                happens because the VT family of terminals does not support fields.
