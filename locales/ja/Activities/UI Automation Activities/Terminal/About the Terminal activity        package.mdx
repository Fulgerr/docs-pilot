# About the Terminal activity
        package

The Terminal package contains activities designed to connect to a terminal and
            efficiently work within it. You can retrieve text, fields or screen positions, send
            keys, text, or wait for certain text or fields to appear as triggers.

Terminal Session is the activity that enables the user to connect to a specific
            terminal environment, using a direct connection or a 3rd party terminal emulation, such
            as Attachmate Reflection, Attachmate Extra, Rocket Bluezone, IBM
                Personal Communications, Reflection for UNIX, Reflection for IBM
            or other IBM EHLLAPI compatible terminal emulators.
