# Release notes


## v25.4.0

Release date: May 13, 2025

# What's new

* In the latest update of Mobile Automation, we have upgraded the package to .NET8, offering an improved performance and compatibility with the latest .NET enhancements.
* You can now leverage existing connections between a mobile device and an application, using the Use Existing Connection property from the Mobile Device Connection activity. Enabling this property reduces execution time, by using existing connections.

# Improvements

We have made a series of performance enhancements aimed at improving the efficiency
                and stability of the mobile device manager:Operations now switch context only when necessary.Frequently used contexts are now stored in memory, with automatic refresh of
                        stale data, reducing redundant queries.Only untagged WebView
                        elements are processed, cutting down on unnecessary executions.We have introduced locks to prevent excessive context switching, improving
                        the overall stability.We optimized the retry timing and reduced the wait on failures.Package and context data are now cached to avoid repeated and costly
                        queries, particularly on Android.By default, the uipath:useCachedPageSource capability is
                        enabled to optimize page source retrieval. Visit  for
                        more information.

# Bug fixes

* A Computer Vision server URL was required for the local Computer Vision server to work as expected within mobile automation workflows. The issue
* Selectors indicated at design time using activities were not identifiable at runtime.
* While selecting an object in the mobile device manager, the Computer Vision section of the object selection did not display its contents when selected, or when using the Ctrl + k shortcut. This dropdown list now correctly appears when you right-click or use the Ctrl + K shortcut for variable selection.

# Improvements

Starting a device from either the Mobile Device Manager, the Mobile Device
                    Connection activity or the Connect API no longer requires providing
                an app or an URL. If no app or URL is provided when starting a device, it will
                launch displaying the homescreen without opening an app.

# What's New

Computer Vision for Mobile Automation

Computer
                Vision uses UiPath's advanced neural network capabilities to enable the seamless
                identification of UI elements through Robots. Computer Vision empowers you to
                automate UI elements that were previously challenging to identify and automate. You
                can use Computer Vision as a selection option when indicating the target for an
                activity.

The activities that employ Computer Vision are:

* Get Text
* Set Text
* Tap
* Element Exists

To start using Computer Vision, you must enable it for mobile automation. Visit
                     to learn how to
                enable Computer Vision for your project.

Release date: April 7, 2023

# What's new

Oftentimes proxies interfere with the applications you’re trying to automate mobile
                testing for. That’s why we made it possible for you to add custom HTTP headers into
                your testing projects, to ease your mobile automation experience. Custom HTTP
                headers allow you to work with proxies that accept only certain headers, by
                specifically adding them.

The Mobile Automation activity package has been divided into two separate activity
                packages:

* UiPath.Mobile.Automation.Activities - This package is used for designing and customizing workflows.
* UiPath.Mobile.Automation.Activities.Runtime - This package is used for running workflows.

The purpose of this change is to make mobile automations run faster. If you want to
                both design and run your mobile automation workflows, make sure to download both
                packages.

Add whatever text you want inside an active UI element, using the new Type
                    Text activity! This activity takes the content that you type through the
                keyboard and pastes it into the currently active UI element. The Type Text
                activity is designed to allow users to input text into UI elements that are
                otherwise inaccessible via selectors.

The interaction between users and mobile devices is complex, sometimes requiring them
                to draw paths on the device screen. Now you can accomplish that by using the new
                    Draw Pattern activity! For example, now you can automate unlocking a
                mobile device pattern, that requires drawing a path on the screen.

# Improvements

We have updated the UX for the Swipe and Draw pattern actions in the Mobile Device Manager, providing an improved visual design. When swiping to a predefined location, you can now view the positional swipe on the Mobile Device Manager screen as a line. Additionally, swipe operations performed with Selection by absolute position enabled are imported as a Positional Swipe activity.

# Bug fixes

For devices using iOS version 15.4, adding any desired capabilities caused the connection to fail when opening the Start page. Even if you input a mobile device connection in the Input Connection property field, you were still required to input an Appium Url.


## v21.10.6

Release date: December 7, 2022

# Improvements

Updated internal dependencies to match the newest version of UI Automation.


## v22.10.2

Release date: December 5, 2022

# New features

The Mobile Automation user interface is now available in Traditional Chinese.

# Improvements

To provide compatibility with Appium 2.0, all known capabilities that are
                forced inside the AppiumSessionFactory now have an
                    appium: prefix, similarly to the one for Appium 1.0.

Enhanced the accessibility for the Mobile Device Manager.


## v22.10.1

Release date: October 24, 2022

# Improvements

Target
                coordinates

The activities that contain a Target selector now support
            expressions for offsetting a target. You can define these input arguments using Tap
                Offset.

All positional activities include a Target selector
            to specify the element position, including a fuzzy selector and a coordinate
            system.

As part of the new coordinate system, you can now use Device Independent
                    Pixel to indicate targets based on the pixel density of the area. You can
                use this parameter in the Take Screenshot Part and Positional Swipe
                activities to run workflows on devices with similar density screens.

# Bug fixes

* An issue occurring during live mobile executions in Mobile Device Manager caused the mobile connection to be unresponsive.
* An error occurred if the Robot executed a test as an Administrator while Studio and Mobile Device Manager, respectively, were opened without elevated privileges.


## v22.8.0

Release date: August 26, 2022

# Improvements

Automation for React Native Apps

Unable to identify the right elements for your tests? Now you can use the React Native Demo App for iOS to learn how to make specific components automatable.

Build automation for React Native app

Activities

Added two activities to help you make calls to specific API endpoints and execute
                native mobile commands:

* Get Session Identifier: Retrieve the current session identifier to call Appium endpoints through HTTP requests.
* Execute Command: Execute native mobile commands such as reading the battery info or dismissing alerts.

You can now take capture rectangle-shaped screenshots on your mobile device screen
                using Take Screenshot Part.

Added the ability to swipe to a specific location on the screen, with starting and
                ending points. The Positional Swipe activity is useful for objects that may
                not be easily automated using the standard Swipe activity due to
                unconventiona; custom control implementation or an inaccessible web view.

When you configure a device, the Appium Url field now provides an inline error
                message stating that HTTPS is not supported.
