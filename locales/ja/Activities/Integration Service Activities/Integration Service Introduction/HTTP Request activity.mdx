# HTTP Request activity

# Overview

The HTTP Request activity enables you to perform HTTP requests to a specified
                API by using the existing connector and connection configuration.

Why choose HTTP Request over other activities for a given connector?

With HTTP Request, you can make requests to any endpoint of a vendor's API,
                accessing its full capabilities. This means you can now go beyond the
                functionalities of predefined activities offered by an Integration Service
                connector.

The HTTP Request activity is now available for
                    only a part of Integration Service connectors. It will soon be expanded to every
                    other connector that supports JSON. Check individual activity package release
                    notes to learn when the activity is enabled for a specific connector. It is also
                    available by default for any custom connector created with Connector
                    Builder.

Limitations

* Connectors built on SOAP APIs or SDKs do not support this activity.
* File download or upload actions are not currently supported.
* This activity currently only takes in application/json for content type.

# Project compatibility

HTTP Request activities are available in Studio Web and in Studio Desktop
                Windows and Cross-platform projects.

# Configuration

* Connection ID - The connection established in Integration Service. Access the dropdown menu to choose, add, or manage connections. This connection is the same as for any other activities on this connector
* Method - The request method to be used when calling the API. The following HTTP verbs are supported:GET - Method used to request data from a specified resource.DELETE - Method used to delete data from a specified resource.PATCH - Method used to apply partial modifications to a resource.POST - Method used to send data to the server.PUT - Method used to send data to the server to update a resource.
* Base URL - Indicates the base URL for the request. This is read-only and provided by the connector. If your endpoint requires a different Base URL/path, it is likely a change request or a custom HTTP request through the Web activity package.
* Endpoint - Indicates the endpoint path for the request. This field will be concatenated to the read-only Base URL field.
* Headers - The request headers. Use the Dictionary editor to add headers. The default headers sent by the connector to the vendor are already displayed in the information box. This header dictionary field allows you to add additional headers.
* Query parameters - The query parameters. Use the Dictionary editor to add new parameters.Example: query value "select * from Vendor" (for QuickBooks Online).
* Body - Input a JSON payload that is sent to the endpoint provided.





* Response content - The response received from the HTTP request. This is a JSON and can be deserialized.
* Response status - The status code received from the HTTP request, as an integer variable.
* Response headers - The response received from the HTTP request.
