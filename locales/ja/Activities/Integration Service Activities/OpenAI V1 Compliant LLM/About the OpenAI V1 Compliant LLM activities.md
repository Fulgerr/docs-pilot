# About the OpenAI V1 Compliant LLM activities

The OpenAI V1 Compliant LLM connector allows you to connect to any LLM model if its API
            follows the OpenAI V1  standard.

The OpenAI V1 API standard includes certain endpoints and methods for sending requests
            and receiving responses. If a third-party model implements its API to follow this
            standard, the connector is able to interface with that model in the same way it does
            with OpenAI’s models.
