                your connection to the Microsoft Teams connector to add the

# HTTP Request activity

A new HTTP Request activity is now available, allowing you to go beyond the
                predefined activities in a given package and make requests to any endpoint of a
                vendor's API.

HTTP Request reuses the connector pre-configuration and provides transparency
                of headers, authentication, and query parameters. You can reuse any of your
                connections, and provide the endpoint and the JSON payload. Use this
                connector-specific HTTP Request activity to benefit from Integration
                Service's capabilities for connection management.

# New Features and Improvements

The Microsoft Teams activities pack is no longer in preview, as this version marks
                the first official release.

This activity pack is now always displayed in the Available section of the
                Activities panel in Studio. Any activity in this package can be installed by simply
                dragging and dropping it into the canvas. Also, a cloud versioning model is used
                from now on for this package, as updates will be done automatically to the
                activities, without the neccesity of manually updating the package by using the
                    Package Manager.

Please note that from this version onwards, this activity pack is only compatible
                    with Studio v2023.10 and above.
