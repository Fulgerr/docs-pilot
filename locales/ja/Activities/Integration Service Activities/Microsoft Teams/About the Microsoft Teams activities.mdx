# About the Microsoft Teams activities

Teams is a collaborative workspace within Microsoft 365/Office 365 that acts as a central hub for workplace conversations, collaborative teamwork, video conferencing, and document sharing, all designed to enhance employee productivity.



To learn more about the Microsoft Teams activities, see the Activities page for a complete activity list and descriptions.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Microsoft Teams, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Microsoft Teams.

Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.
