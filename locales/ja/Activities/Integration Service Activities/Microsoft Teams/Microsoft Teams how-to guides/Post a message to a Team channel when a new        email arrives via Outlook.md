# Post a message to a Team channel when a new
        email arrives via Outlook

Applications Used: Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Teams

Description:Often, email is the preferred mode of communication for important
            announcements, ticket updates, etc. This means a user has to manually browse through
            emails in order to ensure nothing important is missed. Another problem that users face
            is regular spams from advertisers of products. The aim of this automation is to reduce
            this manual toil by posting a message to a team channel whenever a new email arrives in
            order to ensure the user is aware of all the important emails without leaving their
            collaboration tool.

The workflow uses Microsoft Teams activities Get Team by Name, Get Channel by
                Name and Send Channel Message along with Microsoft Office 365 event Email Received.
