# About the Keap activities

Keap is a cloud-based CRM and email marketing system. After connecting, you can easily manage customers, order entries, inventory, and accept payments.



To learn more about the Keap activities, see the Activities page for a complete list and descriptions.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Keap, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Keap. Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.

Once established, the connection to the Keap instance can be used in all activities of the package.
