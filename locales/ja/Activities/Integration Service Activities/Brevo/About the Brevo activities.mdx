# About the Brevo activities

Brevo, formerly Sendinblue, offers a cloud-based marketing communication software suite with email marketing, transactional email, marketing automation, customer-relationship management, landing pages, SMS marketing and more.

# Brevo activity package

Once established, the connection to the Brevo instance can be reused in all activities in the package.

To learn more about the Brevo activities, see the Activities page for a complete activity list and links to the activity details.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Brevo, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Brevo.

Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.
