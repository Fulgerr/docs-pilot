# About the Drip activities

As a customer-centric marketing automation platform, Drip helps brands understand their customers and drive revenue through email, pop-ups, and automation.

# Drip activity package

Once established, the connection to the Drip instance can be reused in all activities in the package.

To learn more about the Drip activities, see the Activities page for a complete activity list and links to the activity details.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Drip, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Drip.

Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.
