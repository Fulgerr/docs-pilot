# Using the query

The CEQL (“Where” filter) provides a standard way to search across all the connectors. Many
        API providers support some form of searching in their APIs but each one approaches searching
        differently. Rather than having you research how to query each resource at a provider, we've
        normalized your search experience. It translates your queries to the API provider's search
        syntax. You compose queries with available query connectors field selection. Each connector
        allows different components of the query, but in most situations you can use some common
        parts.
