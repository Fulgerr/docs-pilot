# About the Salesforce activities

Salesforce is a cloud-based CRM and sales platform used to manage opportunities, relationships, progress, and more. Automate parts of the sales cycle, from lead management to report generation.

To learn more about the Salesforce activities, see the Activities page for a complete activity list and details.

If you're using a version of the Salesforce activity package that does not support Integration Service, you can access its documentation in the Classic Integrations Activities guide.

# Prerequisites

To use the Salesforce activities, you need a Salesforce account and a UiPath for Salesforce app. These can be acquired from your Salesforce Administrator. Alternatively, RPA Developers can use a Salesforce Developer account for automating processes in Salesforce.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Salesforce, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Salesforce.

Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.
