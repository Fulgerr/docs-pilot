# About the PayPal activities

PayPal is an e-commerce payment gateway that facilitates online payments in a faster and safer way, where one can get started by creating a merchant account to accept payments.



To learn more about the PayPal activities, see the Activities page for a complete list and descriptions.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and PayPal, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for PayPal. Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.

Once established, the connection to the PayPal instance can be used in all activities of the package.
