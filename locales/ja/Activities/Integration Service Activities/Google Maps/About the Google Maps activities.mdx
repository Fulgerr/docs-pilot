# About the Google Maps activities

Google Maps furnishes comprehensive details about global geographical areas and landmarks inclusive of geocodes.

To learn more about the Google Maps activities, see the Activities page for a complete activity list and links to the activity details.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Google Maps, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Google Maps.

Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.
