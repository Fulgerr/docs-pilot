## How to query all attachments of an incident

This guide explains who to query the attachments of an incident using a List All
                    Attachments activity.In ServiceNow, the sys_attachment table stores the information of
                all attachments for all tables (incidents, tasks, requisition items, catalog items,
                etc.). To filter results, you must provide the table_name and the
                    sys_id using the where clause. If you don't specify both the
                        table_name_name and the sys_id, the List All
                        Attachments activity returns all attachments for all tables. The following examples shows how to use the List All
                    Attachments activity with a filter to retrieve the file name of a
                specific attachment.

Add a ServiceNow Get Record activity to your workflow.For the Select object field, select Incident.The Get Record activity outputs an Incident object. This allows
                    you to later retrieve the sys_id of the incidents table.Add a List
                        All Attachments activity.Set up a filter using the Where field. Configure the following
                    conditions:"Table sys ID Equals Incident Sys Id". To retrieve the
                                Incident Sys Id:Select Use variable, select the Incident output
                                    object of Get Record.Use the dropdown properties list to find the
                                        sys_id property. Alternatively,
                                    you can use the Expression editor to type
                                        incident.sys_id.Retrieving the sys_id from the Incident
                                                  output objectRetrieving the sys_id from the Incident
                                                  output object"Table name Equals <incident>".Next, add a Log Message activity. For the Message field:Select Use variable and select the output of List All
                                Attachments.Use the dropdown properties list to select the
