Any curation done on these APIs, therefore, will only work with standard implementations of ServiceNow. If, for instance, you've changed the incident table name and altered the fields in terms of names and/or added new required fields, you'll need to use the generic activities (Get Record, List All Records, Insert Record, Update Record, Delete Record) to interact successfully with your instance of ServiceNow.Reach out to your ServiceNow administrator to determine what's necessary to interact with the resources for your use case.
