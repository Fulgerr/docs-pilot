# About the ServiceNow activity package

# Overview

ServiceNow delivers digital workflows that create great experiences and unlock productivity for employees and the enterprise.



Incident Tasks are currently not available as part of Incident curation, but will be added in a future release.

# ServiceNow activity package

The activities give your UiPath robot(s) the ability to manage your records (get, update, insert,
                and delete). If you're using a version of the ServiceNow activity package that
                doesn't support Integration Service, you can access its documentation here.

To learn more about the ServiceNow activities, see the Activities page for a complete activity list and links to the activity detail pages.

# Get Started

The  provide step-by-step
                instructions to help you create working samples of the different activities so that
                you can verify the connection to your ServiceNow instance and get familiar with the
                input/output properties.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and ServiceNow, the activities establish an
                authenticated connection to the ServiceNow API via
                the ServiceNow
                Connector. Before you build your first project, complete the steps in
                the Authentication guide
                from the connector documentation.
