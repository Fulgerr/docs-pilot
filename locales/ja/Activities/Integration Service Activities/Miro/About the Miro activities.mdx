# About the Miro activities

Miro, previously known as RealtimeBoard, offers an easy-to-use platform for visual collaboration and whiteboard activities, designed to cater to the needs of teams from various functional areas.



To learn more about the Miro activities, see the Activities page for a complete list and descriptions.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Miro, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Miro. Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.

Once established, the connection to the Miro instance can be used in all activities of the package.
