# About the Zoom activities

Zoom video conferencing enables users to connect online for live meetings, webinars, and video conferencing from desktop computers, mobile apps, and more. The UiPath.Zoom.IntegrationService.Activities package gives you the ability to manage your Zoom meetings (schedule one-time or recurring meetings), invite meeting registrants, and create meeting invitation links.

To learn more about the Zoom activities, see the Activities page for a complete activity list and links to the activity detail pages.

# How It Works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Zoom, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Zoom.

Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.
