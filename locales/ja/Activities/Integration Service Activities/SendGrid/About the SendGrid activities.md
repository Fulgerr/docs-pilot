# About the SendGrid activities

The UiPath.SendGrid.IntegrationService.Activities package enables you to automate SendGrid processes. It connects to the service via the UiPath Connector for SendGrid. You can find out more information about our connector from the About SendGrid page.

# SendGrid activity package

Once established, the connection to the SendGrid instance can be reused in all subsequent child Scope activities.

To learn more about the SendGrid activities, see the Activities page for a complete activity list and links to the activity details.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and SendGrid, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for SendGrid.

Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.
