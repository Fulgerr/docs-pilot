# About the Intercom activities

Intercom is an application specializing in business messaging. It provides businesses with a way to chat with their customers, to offer product support, and customize engagement with prospective customers.



To learn more about the Intercom activities, see the Activities page for a complete list and descriptions.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Intercom, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Intercom. Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.
