# About the Adobe PDF Services activities

Adobe PDF Services brings a set of powerful cloud-based APIs to integrate multi-step document workflows into any application. Use document generation to create custom PDF documents from Word templates and JSON data. You can find out more information about our connector from the About Adobe PDF Services page.

To learn more about the Adobe PDF Services activities, see the Activities page for a complete activity list and links to the activity details.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Adobe PDF Services, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Adobe PDF Services.

Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.
