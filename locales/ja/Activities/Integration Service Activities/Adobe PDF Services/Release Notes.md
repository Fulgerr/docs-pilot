Most of the activities available in the previous version of this package have been
            deprecated. This release includes only seven activities: Compress a PDF, Create a PDF
            from other format, Export a PDF to other formats, Linearize a PDF, Create a word or PDF
            document, Download File, and Get Record.

The Scope activity has also been deprecated. You no longer have to drag and drop an
            activity inside the Adobe PDF Services Scope activity to configure a connection. You can
            simply add your activity to the workflow and configure the connection using the
                Connection field.
