# About the Freshsales activities

Freshsales is a customer relationship management software that helps businesses manage leads, sales, and customer interactions efficiently.

To learn more about the Freshsales activities, see the Activities page for a complete list and descriptions.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Freshsales, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Freshsales. Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.
