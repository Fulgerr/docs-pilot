# About the Microsoft Sentiment activities

The sentiment analysis connector provides sentiment labels (such as "negative", "neutral" and "positive") based on the highest confidence score found by the service at a sentence and document-level.



To learn more about the Microsoft Sentiment activities, see the Activities page for a complete list and details.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Microsoft Sentiment, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Microsoft Sentiment.

Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.
