# How to use the Search Tickets activity 

The Zoho Desk APIs offer support for two search types: exact match and wildcard match.

An exact match retrieves resources only when the provided value precisely matches a resource in the help desk.

A wildcard match retrieves resources even if the provided value partially matches a resource in the help desk. To execute a wildcard match, simply append an asterisk (*) after the search value.

Find below some common instances illustrating how to execute a query on the Search Tickets activity.

# Search for tickets assigned to an agent with a High priority and an Open status

Start by using a Search Agents activity to retrieve the agent ID. If you already know it, you can use  Search Tickets directly.In the  Search Tickets activity, set the query to: priority=High&status=Open&assigneeID=0000. For the assignee ID, you can use the exact string or the ID property retrieved as a variable using the Search Agents activity.

# Search for tickets where Subject matches UiPath

Use a  Search Tickets activity and set the query as follows: subject=UiPath*.Add a For Each activity. For the List of items field, select the Tickets output from the previous activity.Inside the For Each, add a Write Line activity and set the text to: currentItem.subject.
