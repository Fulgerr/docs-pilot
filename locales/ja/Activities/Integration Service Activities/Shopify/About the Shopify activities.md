# About the Shopify activities

Shopify is one of the most popular e-commerce platforms that allows you to create an online shopping experience for your customers, starting from listing products to order management and capturing payments.



To learn more about the Shopify activities, see the Activities page for a complete list and descriptions.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Shopify, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Shopify. Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.

Once established, the connection to the Shopify can be used in all activities of the package.
