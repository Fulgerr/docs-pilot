# About the Coupa activities

Coupa is a cloud-based business spend management platform. After connecting, you can automate spend-related work, from management of supply chains and procurement to expense and payment processing.

To learn more about the Coupa activities, see the Activities page for a complete list and details.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Coupa, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Coupa.

Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.
