# Using the Where clause

# Untitled Section

Advanced users who want to build their own queries can use the Where clause. This requires following the API documentation.

For example, let's take the following scenario: you want to use the Where clause to filter out all reports with an Approval Status Code of A_APPR. To do this:

1. See the parameter names from SAP Concur Developer Center | Reports v3.
2. Copy the approvalStatusCode and the code, A_APPR in this case.
3. In the List All Records activity, in the Where field, click the Plus button menu to select Set using an Expression, and enter:"approvalStatusCode='A_APPR'".

The WHERE clause uses string inputs, which must be wrapped between within "".
