# About the Trello activities

Trello is the ultimate project management tool. Start up a board in seconds, automate tedious tasks, and collaborate anywhere.



To learn more about the Trello activities, see the Activities page for a complete list and descriptions.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Trello, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Trello. Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.

Once established, the connection to the Trello instance can be used in all activities of the package.
