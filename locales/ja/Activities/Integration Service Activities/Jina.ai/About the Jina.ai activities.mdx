# About the Jina.ai activities

Given a URL as input, the Jina.ai Reader activity returns the content of the page as Markdown text. The Reader endpoint extracts the core content from a URL and converts it into clean, LLM-friendly text.



To learn more about the Jina.ai activities, see the  page for a complete activity list.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Jina.ai, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Jina.ai.

Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.
