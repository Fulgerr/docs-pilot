# About the BambooHR activities

BambooHR is cloud-based HR software that collects and organizes all the information you gather throughout the employee life cycle. The connector can be used to manipulate employee data and to generate reports in several formats.



To learn more about the Bamboo HR activities, see the Activities page for a complete list and descriptions.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Bamboo HR, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for BambooHR.

Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.
