# About the Microsoft Translator activities

The Microsoft Translator activities package enables you to automate Microsoft Translator processes. It connects to the service via the UiPath Connector for Microsoft Translator. You can find out more information about our connector from the About Microsoft Translator page.

# Microsoft Translator Activities Package

Once established, the connection to the Microsoft Translator instance can be reused in all subsequent child activities.

To learn more about the Microsoft Translator activities, see the Activities page for a complete activity list and links to the activity details.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Microsoft Translator, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Microsoft Translator.

Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.
