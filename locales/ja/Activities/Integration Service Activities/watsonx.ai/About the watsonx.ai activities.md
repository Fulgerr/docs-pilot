# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and watsonx.ai, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for watsonx.ai. Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.

Once established, the connection to the watsonx.ai instance can be used in all activities of the package.
