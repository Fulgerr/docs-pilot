# About the Act! 365 activities

Act 365! is a cloud based customer relationship management (CRM) and marketing solution designed primarily for small & midsized businesses. It provides essential customer management, email marketing, sales acceleration tools and allows users to manage prospects, lead data, contact details, potential opportunities, track interactions and take down notes–all from a single platform, eliminating the need for multiple systems.
