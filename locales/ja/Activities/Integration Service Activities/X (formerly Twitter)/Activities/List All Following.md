UiPath.Twitter.IntegrationService.Activities.ListAllFollowing

# Description

Uses the GET /2/users/:id/following API to list all users that are being followed by the current user on X.

# Project Compatibility

Windows | Cross-platform

# Configuration

* ConnectionId - The connection established in Integration Service. Access the drop-down to choose, add or manage connections. This field supports String type input.
* User ID - The ID of the user.
* Max Records - The maximum number of records to return.

# Advanced

Options

* Expansions - Expansions enable you to request additional data objects that relate to the originally returned users. The ID that represents the expanded data object is included directly in the user data object, but the expanded object metadata is returned within the includes response object, and also includes the ID so that you can match this data object to the original Tweet object. At this time, the only expansion available to endpoints that primarily return user objects is expansions=pinned_tweet_id.
* User Fields - A comma separated list of User fields to display. Available values: created_at, description, entities, id, location, name, pinned_tweet_id, profile_image_url, protected, public_metrics, url, username, verified, withheld.

Output

* Users - The output list of user objects.
