# About the QuickBooks Online activities

The UiPath.QuickBooksOnline.IntegrationService.Activities package enables you to automate QuickBooks Online processes. It connects to the service via the UiPath Connector for QuickBooks Online. You can find out more information about our connector from the About QuickBooks Online page.

# QuickBooks Online Activities Package

Once established, the connection to the QuickBooks Online instance can be reused in all subsequent child activities.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and QuickBooks Online, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for QuickBooks Online.

Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.
