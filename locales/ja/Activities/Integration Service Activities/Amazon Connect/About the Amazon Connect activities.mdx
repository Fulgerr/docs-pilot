# About the Amazon Connect activities

Amazon Connect is an omnichannel contact center as a service (CCaaS) solution that offers easy, self-service configuration and enables dynamic, personal, and natural customer engagement including voice interactions at any scale.



To learn more about the Amazon Connect activities, see the  page for a complete list and descriptions.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Amazon Connect, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Amazon Connect. Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.

Once established, the connection to the Amazon Connect instance can be used in all activities of the package.
