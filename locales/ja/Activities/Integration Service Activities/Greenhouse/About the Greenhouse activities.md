# About the Greenhouse activities

Greenhouse is an applicant tracking system and recruiting software that is designed to help make companies great at hiring and gives the tools to make better, fairer and more confident hiring decisions.



# Greenhouse activity package

Once established, the connection to the Greenhouse instance can be reused in all activities in the package.

To learn more about the Greenhouse activities, see the Activities page for a complete activity list and links to the activity details.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Greenhouse, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Greenhouse.

Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.
