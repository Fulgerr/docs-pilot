# About the Campaign Monitor activities

Campaign Monitor is a cloud-based email marketing platform. It provides easy to use email marketing automated tools and fully-featured email platforms that can be used to create, send, and optimize the email marketing campaigns, by teams of all size.

To learn more about the Campaign Monitor activities, see the Activities page for a complete list and details.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Campaign Monitor, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Campaign Monitor.

Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.
