# HTTP Request activity

A new HTTP Request activity is now available, allowing you to go beyond the
                predefined activities in a given package and make requests to any endpoint of a
                vendor's API.

HTTP Request reuses the connector pre-configuration and provides transparency
                of headers, authentication, and query parameters. You can reuse any of your
                connections, and provide the endpoint and the JSON payload. Use this
                connector-specific HTTP Request activity to benefit from Integration
                Service's capabilities for connection management.
