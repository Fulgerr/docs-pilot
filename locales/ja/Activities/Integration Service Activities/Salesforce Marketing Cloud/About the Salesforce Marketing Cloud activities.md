# About the Salesforce Marketing Cloud activities

Salesforce Marketing Cloud is a cloud-based digital marketing automation and analytics solution used to manage activities, campaigns, and contacts across multiple Marketing Elements and other Salesforce services. It includes integrated solutions for customer journey management, email, mobile, social, web personalization, advertising, content creation and management, and data analysis.



To learn more about the Salesforce Marketing Cloud activities, see the Activities page for a complete list and descriptions.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Salesforce Marketing Cloud, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Salesforce Marketing Cloud. Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.

Once established, the connection to the Salesforce Marketing Cloud instance can be used in all activities of the package.
