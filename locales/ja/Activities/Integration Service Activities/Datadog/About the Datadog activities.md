# About the Datadog activities

Datadog offers observability services tailored for cloud-scale applications. It monitors servers, databases, tools, and services using a data analytics platform.



To learn more about the Datadog activities, see the Activities page for a complete list and descriptions.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Datadog, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Datadog. Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.

Once established, the connection to the Datadog instance can be used in all activities of the package.
