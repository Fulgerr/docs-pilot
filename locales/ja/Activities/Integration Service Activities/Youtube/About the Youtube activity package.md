# About the Youtube activity package

YouTube is a video sharing website that makes it easy for you to watch videos online and even upload your own videos to share with others.



To learn more about the YouTube activities, see the Activities page for a
            complete activity list and details.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and YouTube, the activities establish an
                authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for YouTube. Before you build
                your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector
                documentation.
