# About the Amazon SES activities

Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) is a flexible and scalable email sending service designed for marketing, notification, and transactional emails. It offers high deliverability, easy integration through SMTP or APIs, and comprehensive sending analytics, catering to the needs of developers and marketers alike.



To learn more about the Amazon SES activities, see the Activities page for a complete list and descriptions.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Amazon SES, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Amazon SES. Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the  Authentication guide from the connector documentation.

Once established, the connection to the Amazon SES instance can be used in all activities of the package.
