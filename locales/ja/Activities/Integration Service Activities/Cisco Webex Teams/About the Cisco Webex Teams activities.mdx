# About the Cisco Webex Teams activities

Cisco Webex Teams is an organizational communication and collaboration platform. After connecting, automate user and room management, messaging, file sharing and other ways to work together.

See the Activities page for a complete activity list and details.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Cisco Webex Teams, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Cisco Webex Teams.

Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.
