# Queries limitation

Oracle Eloqua has a limitation on the way queries can be constructed. That is, if more than one
                clause is added to the query parameter, it chains them together to form either an
                AND or an OR clause internally. If more than one non-date fields are included in the
                where clause, it becomes an OR operation. Even if at least one date field is
                included in the WHERE clause it becomes an AND operation.

We added the following CEQL examples to help you better understand this.

CEQL Example 1

name='Harsha' AND lastname='Gangavarapu'

The above where clause will be chained as name='Harsha'lastname='Gangavarapu' for the Eloqua API. So with the limitation in place, this will be an OR search operation as there are no date fields. Hence this where clause will be changed to name='Harsha' OR lastname='Gangavarapu'.

CEQL Example 2

createdAt>'2021-07-11T05:55:00' AND name='Harsha'

The above where clause will be chained as name='Harsha'createdAt='Gangavarapu'
                for the Eloqua API. So with the limitation in place, this will be an AND search
                operation as there is at least one date field.

This Where clause will be changed to name='Harsha' AND
                    createdAt>'2021-07-11T05:55:00'.
