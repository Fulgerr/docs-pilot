# About the HubSpot Marketing activities

HubSpot Marketing is a cloud-based marketing platform. It integrates seamlessly with the HubSpot CRM and works to help your marketing team draw in and nurture more qualified leads. The HubSpot Marketing Hub helps your company increase website traffic and convert more visitors into leads. After connecting, you can automate tasks like social media and content creation, email campaign management, and analytics and data reporting.
