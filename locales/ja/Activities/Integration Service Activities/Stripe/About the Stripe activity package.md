# About the Stripe activity package

Stripe is an online payment processing and commerce solution with multiple payment methods.

# How it works

To enable the channel between UiPath and Stripe, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Stripe. Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.

# Stripe activity package

Once established, the connection to the Stripe instance can be used in all activities of the package. To learn more about the Stripe activities, see the Activities page for a complete activity list and links to the activity details.
