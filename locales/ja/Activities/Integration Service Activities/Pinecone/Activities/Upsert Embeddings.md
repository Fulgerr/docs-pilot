# Upsert Embeddings

# Description

This operation writes embeddings (vectors) into an index. If a new value is upserted
                for an existing vector ID, it overwrites the previous value. This activity can be
                used to upload documents and create knowledge bases which can in turn be referenced
                to achieve retrieval augmented generation (RAG) use cases.

# Project Compatibility

Windows | Cross-platform

# Configuration

ConnectionId - The
                        connection established in Integration Service. Access the drop-down to
                        choose, add or manage connections.Embeddings - An array
                        containing the embeddings to upsert. Recommended batch limit is 100
                        vectors.Metadata - The
                        metadata of the input embeddings.Namespace - The namespace is a subset within the index that the
                        Pinecone connection is associated with. Namespaces can be used for indexing
                        different types of content. If not identified, the entire index is
                        referenced.

# Manage Properties Wizard

The Manage Properties Wizard can be used to configure or use any of the object’s
                standard or custom fields by selecting and adding them to the activity canvas. The
                added standard/custom fields are available in the Properties panel (in Studio
                Desktop) or under Additional options (in Studio Web).
