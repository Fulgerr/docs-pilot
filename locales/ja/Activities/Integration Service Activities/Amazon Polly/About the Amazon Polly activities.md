# About the Amazon Polly activities

Amazon Polly is a service that turns text into lifelike speech, allowing you to create applications that talk.



To learn more about the Amazon Polly activities, see the Activities page for a complete list and descriptions.

Amazon Polly currently supports the conversion of short texts to speech, i.e., up to 500 words. This is ideal for converting summaries and conclusions to text rather than entire document contents. A separate resource to support longer text and speech duration will be introduced in future releases.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Amazon Polly, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Amazon Polly. Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.

Once established, the connection to the Amazon Polly instance can be used in all activities of the package.
