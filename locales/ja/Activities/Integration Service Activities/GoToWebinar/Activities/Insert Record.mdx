# FAQ: Which activity to use for creating a webinar

You can use one of the following three activities for creating a webinar:

* Create single session webinar
* Quick create webinar
* Insert Record

For creating a webinar that is scheduled to be held once, use the Create single
                    session webinar activity.

Quick create webinar requires you to build a webinar on top of a collection.
                Note that this can be somewhat difficult to implement. For a better experience, use
                    Create single session webinar.

Use Insert Record for Webinar object to create webinars of different
                types. For example, the types can be sequence and series, as well on top of a single
                session webinar. If you wish to create a specific type of webinar, use Insert
                    Record.
