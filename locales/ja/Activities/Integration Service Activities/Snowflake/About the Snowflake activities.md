# About the Snowflake activities

Snowflake is a web-based data warehousing platform. After connecting to the UiPath connector for Snowflake, you can bring advanced automation capabilities to every step of your enterprise data processing and management.



To learn more about the Snowflake activities, see the Activities page for a complete list and details.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Snowflake, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Snowflake.

Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.
