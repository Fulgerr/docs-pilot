# About the DocuSign activities

DocuSign is a cloud-based service for electronic signatures and approvals. With unmatched availability and legal enforceability, DocuSign helps businesses of all sizes easily and securely sign, send and manage documents in the cloud.

# DocuSign activity package

If you're using a version of the DocuSign Activities Pack that does not support the Integration Service, you can access its documentation in the Classic Integrations Activities Guide.

To learn more about the DocuSign activities, see the Activities page for a complete activity list and links to the activity detail

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and DocuSign, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for DocuSign.

Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.
