# Troubleshooting

If the template that is being used to create envelope has Webhooks enabled for listening events, the error below happens:

errorCode - HTTPS_REQUIRED_FOR_CONNECT_LISTENER
message - HTTPS required for Connect listener communication

The support for Webhooks (i.e. DocuSign Connect) is not yet released for DocuSign connector. Thus, only templates (without webhooks) can be used to create envelopes.

The following error can be encountered:

errorCode - NO_AUTHENTICATION_METHOD_FOR_RECIPIENT,
message - This account requires an authentication method for each recipient. Envelope definition is missing an auth method for recipient: test3@gmail.com

To fix this, ensure your DocuSign security settings have the recipient authentication disabled or optional. To set this:

1. Login to your DocuSign account.
2. Click on the Settings tab on the top of the screen.
3. On the left panel, under Account, click on Security Settings.
4. Ensure the recipient authentication is disabled or optional, as shown below:
