### Support for long-running workflows

This connector now supports long-running workflows through the Wait for an Event and
                Resume activity. Its purpose is to suspend a job at runtime and resume the job
            whenever a certain event occurs.

# HTTP Request activity

A new HTTP Request activity is now available, allowing you to go beyond the
                predefined activities in a given package and make requests to any endpoint of a
                vendor's API.

HTTP Request reuses the connector pre-configuration and provides transparency
                of headers, authentication, and query parameters. You can reuse any of your
                connections, and provide the endpoint and the JSON payload. Use this
                connector-specific HTTP Request activity to benefit from Integration
                Service's capabilities for connection management.

We consolidated the Dropbox and Dropbox for Business into a single connector. You can now authenticate with either Dropbox or Dropbox for Business credentials and use the latest version of activities. However, event triggers are available only for Dropbox for Business users. Regular Dropbox users can set up event triggers using the custom HTTP Webhook connector.

This release also includes general updates regarding design time look-ups and enumerable options, as well as some changes in property display names and descriptions.

# New activities

The following activities have been added to the package: Get Folder Items, Suspend a member, Unsuspend Members, Get Member, List Members, Add Members, Remove a Member, and Get File Info.

# Trigger activities

We've introduced several trigger activities: File Created, File Updated, File Trashed, Folder Created, Folder Updated, Folder Trashed, Member Created, Member Updated, and Member Deleted. Aside from these preconfigured, ready-to-use events, you can also set up Record Created, Record Updated, Record Deleted triggers on various Dropbox objects.

# Deprecated

The following activities have been deprecated: Invoke Operation, Native Search, Add Folder, Get Folder Content, Get Folder Details, List Records, and Dropbox Scope. You no longer need to drag and drop an activity inside the Scope to configure a connection. Simply add your activity to the workflow and configure the connection using the Connection field.


## V4.0.3

Both design time and run time now support the ability to select a connection to use in the Configure Connection Wizard. Before, you could only use the connection that was set as default, even when creating multiple connections. With this new functionality, you can now select from the drop-down the connection you want to use in UiPath Studio (design time) and the connection you want to use on the robot (run time) when executing the process.

The Dropbox activities package supports .NET6.
