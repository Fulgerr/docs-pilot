# Untitled Section

text="Type the content"

# Configuration

Issue ID or key - The issue you wish to update. Enter the full issue key, such as ABCD-1234, or the issue ID. You can also use the dropdown list to search for an issue. This field supports String type input.New status - Transitions depend on the issue key above. Provide an issue for the status list to load in the dropdown list. This field supports String type input.

# How it works

The Update Issue Status transitions the status of an issue.

If you want to change the status, you must first select the Issue and then look up the available status options. The New status look-up menu doesn't load any transitions unless you first select an issue key.

If you want to update the status for different issues, you can use a variable for the Issue field and keep the Status field intact.

Alternatively, you can use the List All Records activity with an Issues Transitions object to find the permissible status of an issue dynamically, during execution.
