# Update Issue

# Description

Updates a Jira issue.

# Untitled Section

text="Type the content"

# Configuration

* 
* Project - Select the project from the dropdown list or enter the project name or key. This field supports String type input.Select the Project and the related Issue type to dynamically retrieve additional input properties. Once the input properties are set, you can use a variable for the Issue key or ID field. When using variables, you can still use the same input properties when updating issues, as long as the properties still apply. Alternatively, create a sample Jira project with an issue type that includes all possible fields across various projects and issue types. This enables you to handle different fields in different projects when updating the issue.
* Issue type - The type of issue you wish to retrieve (task, story, bug, epic, etc.). This field supports String type input.
* Issue ID or key - The issue you wish to update. Enter the full issue key, such as ABCD-1234, or the issue ID. You can also use the dropdown list to search for an issue. This field supports String type input.







Additional fields are displayed depending on the selected Project and Issue type.

# How it works

The authenticated Jira account must have sufficient permissions to the respective resource in each activity. Check out Jira project permissions documentation.

The Update Issue activity is very similar to the Create Issue activity. It updates an issue in Jira based on the specified issue’s standard and custom fields that are dynamically retrieved during design time.

Once you set the Project and Issue type fields, you can replace the Project
                and Issue type dynamically, with the help of variables, so that the fields
                remain on your canvas. In this case, you can only add the issue to a project where
                all the fields (or a subset of all the dynamic fields) apply.

Alternatively, you can use a different Issue type to bring in different set of fields. In
                this case, you can only update an issue where all the fields or a subset of the
                fields apply. In this case, you can only update an issue where all the fields or a
                subset of the fields apply.

We recommend that you create a sample Project with an Issue type that contains all
                possible issue fields across multiple projects and issue types, so that you can
                create issues across multiple projects and issue types. This is because issues can
                have different fields in different projects.

Alternatively, when dynamically creating a Jira issue, you can use the Update Record activity with an Issues object. This scenario, however, prevents us from generating your issue input fields during design time and you must work with standard fields like Summary, Description, Assignee, etc.
