# About the Okta activities

Okta streamlines user authentication, access, and identity management, enhancing security and user experience across integrated applications seamlessly.

To learn more about the Okta activities, see the Activities page for a complete activity list and links to the activity details.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Okta, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Okta.

Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.
