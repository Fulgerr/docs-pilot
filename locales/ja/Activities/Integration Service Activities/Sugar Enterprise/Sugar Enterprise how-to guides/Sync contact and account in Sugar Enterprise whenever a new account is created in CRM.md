# Sync contact and account in Sugar Enterprise whenever a new account is created in CRM

Applications Used: Salesforce and Sugar Enterprise

Description: An account in Salesforce represents a customer that has made a
            purchase. In order to maintain data consistency, syncing data across systems is required
            as the same customer could be added to other campaigns or perhaps shared across partner
            teams for cross-selling, etc.
