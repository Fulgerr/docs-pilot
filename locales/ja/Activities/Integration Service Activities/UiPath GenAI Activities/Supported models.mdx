1 LLMs used in UiPath GenAI activities are provisioned by default in your tenant region. If they are not available in your region, they are provisioned in the European Union region. In both cases, no data is saved outside your region.

The Content Generation activity uses all available models. The prompt-based
                activities use Azure Open AI models.

# Model deprecation

In time, LLMs may be deprecated from the AI Trust Layer. This can impact the GenAI activities as
                their outputs can change, thereby affecting workflows. We recommend you test your
                workflows and, where possible, establish validation checks on GenAI activity outputs
                via human in the loop techniques offered in Action Center.

The following deprecation behavior is in place:

For Content Generation:UiPath reserves the right to default to a model from the same vendor, where possible. If no additional model is available, the latest Microsoft model is used. If the deprecated model was generally available (and had a guaranteed SLA), we try to default to a model with a similar level of support.You will be notified when the model you are using is scheduled to be deprecated and what the fallback model is.The deprecated model will no longer be available in the Model name field for new workflows.For prompt-based activities:UiPath reserves the right to default to a model from the same vendor, where possible. If no additional model is available, the latest Microsoft model is used. You will be notified when a model is scheduled to be deprecated and that a different model will be used for your workflows. This allows you to make sure the activity's new output meets your requirements.
