Prompt - The prompt
                        you want to use for the text completion(s) generation, such as: "Write an

                        input.Model ID - The large language model (LLM) to utilize for the

* Max output tokens - The maximum number of tokens allowed for the prompt and generated answer. Fewer tokens are less expensive. Most models support a maximum of 1024 tokens. Default value is 1024.
* Temperature - A number between 0 and 1. Higher values like 0.8 make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 make it more focused and deterministic. Default value is 0.8.
* Top p - A number between 0 and 1. The lower the number, the lesser the randomness of the result. Defaults to 0.8.
* Top k - A number between 1 and 40. The higher the number, the higher the diversity of generated text. Defaults to 40.



* Text - The top generated text completion. Automatically generated output variable.
