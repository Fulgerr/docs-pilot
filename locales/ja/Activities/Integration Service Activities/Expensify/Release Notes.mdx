### Support for long-running workflows

This connector now supports long-running workflows through the Wait for an Event and
                Resume activity. Its purpose is to suspend a job at runtime and resume the job
            whenever a certain event occurs.

# HTTP Request activity

A new HTTP Request activity is now available, allowing you to go beyond the
                predefined activities in a given package and make requests to any endpoint of a
                vendor's API.

HTTP Request reuses the connector pre-configuration and provides transparency
                of headers, authentication, and query parameters. You can reuse any of your
                connections, and provide the endpoint and the JSON payload. Use this
                connector-specific HTTP Request activity to benefit from Integration
                Service's capabilities for connection management.

Starting with this version of the package, Windows - Legacy projects are no longer supported. Instead, you can use the activity package for Windows or Cross-platform projects.

Also starting with version 5.0.2, the activity package has gone scopeless, which means you no longer have to drag and drop an activity inside the Expensify Scope activity to configure a connection. You can simply add your activity into the workflow and configure the connection within each activity using the ConnectionId field.

* Expensify Scope
* Insert Expense Rules
* Update Expense Rules

# Breaking changes

When updating the activity package from version 3.0.0 to version 5.0.2, your workflows won't work anymore and you have to rebuild them as version 5.x or higher is not backwards compatible with version 3.x due to .NET 6 framework compatibility issues.
