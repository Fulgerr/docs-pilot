# About the Expensify activities

Expensify is a web-based expense management system for personal and business use. Working to automate expense management and receipt tracking, it saves you valuable time with one-click expense reports in real-time.



To learn more about the Expensify activities, see the Activities page for a complete activity list and details.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Expensify, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Expensify. Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.
