# About the Todoist activities

Todoist is a to-do and task management application designed for handling both professional and personal projects. It allows the creation of lists, promotes collaboration in the workplace, and aids in monitoring productivity.

# Todoist activity package

Once established, the connection to the Todoist instance can be reused in all activities in the package.

To learn more about the Todoist activities, see the Activities page for a complete activity list and links to the activity details.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Todoist, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Todoist.

Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.
