# Orchestrator Host Settings

On the Orchestrator host portal, system administrators have access to several global settings for Orchestrator. This page describes the options available in this portal and how to use them.

Changes to the host settings apply to all tenants that did not update their settings with custom values.

### General Tab

The following table describes the available settings on the General tab:


| Field | Description |
| --- ---| Application Settings | Timezone - The time zone for all tenants. By default, this field is set to UTC.The time zone list depends on the machine. To ensure that all the instances under a multi-node Orchestrator installation have the same time zone list, they must use the same operating system version.Language - The language of the Orchestrator user interface for all tenants, including email notifications and alerts. This setting does not affect robot logs or event logs, which use the Windows language.Also refer to Changing the organization language settings in Automation Suite.Custom logo - Upload your desired logo which appears in the Orchestrator window header. The accepted formats are .png and .svg, with a maximum file size of 1MB.Also refer to Changing the company logo in Automation Suite.Custom header color - Select a color for the Orchestrator window header. This is useful for distinguishing between multiple Orchestrator tenants. The header color is selected by selecting the colored square to bring up your machine's color selector. |
| Client Binaries (Robot, Studio, Assistant) Auto-Update Settings | Auto-fill available product versions - Configure whether the update policies for all tenants in the organization contain the latest versions of client binaries or if they need to be configured manually. If you need to manage update versions manually, disable this option and follow the steps described in the auto-updating client components article in the Orchestrator guide. |
| Modern Folders | Enable account-machine mappings - Refer to details about configuring account-machine mappings. |
| Classic Folders (deprecated) | Activate Classic Folders - Enable classic folders.Use this setting with caution, since classic folders are deprecated. |

### Deployment Tab

Enables you to configure and secure feeds for packages and libraries. You can manage the feeds for all tenants from a centralized location using Automation Ops. For more information, refer to feeds management in the Automation Ops guide.

These settings only affect tenant feeds; folder feeds and personal workspace feeds are always internal and available in the context of the respective folder or personal workspace alone.


### Robot Security Tab




### Scalability Tab

Specify if the Robot service should subscribe to Orchestrator's SignalR channels, and configure the transport protocols that work best for you.  These settings are preserved upon upgrading.


### Libraries

Enables you to configure the feed to be used for library and activity packages. Libraries can be published from Studio or manually uploaded by the user in Orchestrator and are stored within the chosen feed.

The following table describes the fileds you can enable for library packages:


| Field | Description |

### Prerequisites for Using an External Feed Through a Proxy

If you want to use an external feed while you have a proxy server configured on Windows, the following are required beforehand:

* Set the Load User Profile option for the Orchestrator application pool (Internet Information Services > Application Pools) to True.
* Add the proxy settings you used in the NuGet.config file associated with the application pool identity account (C:\Users\[YourAppPoolIdentityAccountName]\AppData\Roaming\NuGet\NuGet.Config): <config>
<add key="http_proxy" value="http://ipaddress:port" />
</config>
