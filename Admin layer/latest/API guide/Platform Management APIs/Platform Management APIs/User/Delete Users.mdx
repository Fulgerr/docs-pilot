### Example Request

Let's say you gathered all the information needed to build the API call.

* Your {baseURL} is: /{organizationName}/{tenantName}/
* Your {access_token} is: 1234 (for length considerations).
* The {partitionGlobalId} is: magic-7
* The users you want to delete have the following IDs: Dolores Umbridge: dol-2908Quirinus Quirrell: qui-2609

The call should resemble the following example (cURL):

curl --location --request DELETE '/{organizationName}/{tenantName}/identity_/api/User' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer 1234' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'
--data-raw '{
    "partitionGlobalId": "magic-7",
    "userIds": [
        "dol-2908", "qui-2609"
    ]
}'
