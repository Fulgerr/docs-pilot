Let's say you gathered all the information needed to build the API call.

* Your {baseURL} is: /{organizationName}/{tenantName}/
* Your {access_token} is: 1234 (for length considerations).
* The {partitionGlobalId} is: magic-7

--header 'Authorization: Bearer 1234' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'
--data-raw '{
     "robotAccountIDs": [
          "11-xy",
          "22-tz"
     ]
}'
