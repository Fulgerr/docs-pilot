# Bug fixes

* We have fixed an issue causing Automation Suite installations to fail due to Certificate Authority (CA) certificates not being recognized. The issue occurred when the CertificatePolicies section included policy OID values exceeding 4 bytes.
* We have fixed an issue causing the custom changes made to the RKE2 configuration file ( /etc/rancher/rke2/config.yaml ) to be overwritten during upgrades. Now, the custom configurations are preserved.
