### Example Request

Let's say you gathered all the information needed to build the API call.

* Your {baseURL} is: /{organizationName}/{tenantName}/
* Your {access_token} is: 1234 (for length considerations).
* The {partitionGlobalId} is: magic-7

The call should resemble the following example (cURL):

--header 'Authorization: Bearer 1234' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'
--data-raw '{
     "groupIDs": [
          "group1",
          "group2"
     ]
}'
