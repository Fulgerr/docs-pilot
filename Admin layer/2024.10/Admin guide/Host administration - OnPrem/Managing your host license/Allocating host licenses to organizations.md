# Allocating host licenses to organizations

This page describes how to license organizations from the host-level pool of licenses.

If you have a pool of user, robot, and service licenses at the host level, you can allocate a custom number of those licenses to your organizations, thus licensing those organizations.

After you allocate licenses to organizations, organization administrators can further allocate those licenses to the accounts and tenants in their organization, as needed.

The instructions on this page are for system administrators and refer to license allocation at the host level. If you are an organization administrator, follow the instructions in the organization administration section of this guide to allocate licenses for your organization.The amount of time it takes for changes to license allocation for an organization to be propagated to the Orchestrator tenant and to AI Center is set by the License.Cache.Expiration.Minutes parameter and it is set to 5 minutes by default. Do not change this setting to avoid causing configuration errors.

### Allocating licenses to organizations

1. Log in to the host portal as a system administrator.
2. From the panel on the left, select the organization to which you want to allocate licenses, and then select Licenses.
3. Edit the values to allocate the required number of each type of license to the organization. The number of licenses that you have available in the host license pool is shown on the right.
4. When you are done, select Save to allocate the licenses.

The allocated licenses are available within 5 minutes for the organization administrator to allocate them as needed in their organization.


### Removing host licenses from an organization

Doing this leaves the organization as unlicensed and unusable.
