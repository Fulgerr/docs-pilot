# Managing system administrators

System administrators, also known as host administrators, have the required privileges to configure all host-level settings, which apply for all your organizations and tenants.

## First system administrator

After completing the installation, the admin user account is automatically provisioned which has system administrator privileges.

Where can I get the credentials?

The details for the first system administrator account, called admin, are available in the cluster_config.json file.

The user name for the first system administrator account is always admin, and the password is the one you set during installation. For details refer to the installation docs: Windows installer - wizard (UI) | Windows installer - command line (CLI) | Azure - script.

You can use this account to log in to the host portal. If needed, with this account you can create additional system administrator accounts.
