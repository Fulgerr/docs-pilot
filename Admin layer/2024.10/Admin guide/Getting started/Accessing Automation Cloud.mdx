# Accessing Automation Cloud

Automation Cloud™ allows authentication through email, single sign-on (SSO), as well as trusted third-party services such as Google, Microsoft, and LinkedIn.

The management of this ecosystem is under the control of the administrator. Administrators configure access by signing up, creating the organization and adding users. Non-admin users can sign into an organization if an administrator created the organization and configured access for them in that organization.
