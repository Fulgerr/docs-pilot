# Restricting access to a set of users

This feature is only available if you are on the Enterprise licensing plan.

Tenants and services in an organizations are, by default, available to all directory users and groups who authenticate successfully.

Organization administrators can configure an organization access control policy to either allow access to all users in a directory or to restrict access to a specified list of allowed members. For any access attempt, the system checks if they are on the list of allowed entities. If they are not on the list, they are denied access and an error is raised.

Upon enabling the organization access policy, it may take up to one hour for the policy to take effect. Once in effect, users who are restricted by the policy will be denied access to all user-facing services, and services that are accessible using user tokens.

This option is recommended if you want to allow all users in the directory to access the organization without any additional restrictions.Only allowed members: This option restricts access to a specific list of users and groups. Only users and groups on the allowed list will be able to sign in and access the organization, while all other users are denied access.If you selected the Only allowed members policy, you also need to define the list of allowed members.It may take up to one hour for the policy to take effect. Once in effect, users who are restricted by the policy will be denied access to all user-facing services, and services that are accessible using user tokens.
