# Introducing package categorization by
        type

Orchestrator now determines the package type for packages published or uploaded via
                        UiPath® means, such as packages published from Studio or uploaded to an
                        internal feed, and displays them under the appropriate category for each
                        type.

To leverage the new capability, we have made the following changes to the
                        Orchestrator interface:

* In the Tenant context, under the Packages tab, the
                                        old interface featured the Packages and
                                                Libraries grids. The new interface features
                                        the Automations, Libraries, App
                                                versions, and Feed grids. Note that we
                                        have moved the App versions grid from the top-level
                                        menu to its current position under Tenant >
                                                Packages. For an illustration of the
                                        interface changes, refer to the following images: The old
                                                interface for Tenant >

                                                  Packages: For more information on the new package types, refer to Tenant
                                        feed.
* In the Folder context, under Automations >
                                                Folder packages, we have introduced a
                                                Type filter that enables you to display only
                                        folder packages that belong to the types you select. For
                                        more information on folder packages, refer to Folder
                                        feed.
