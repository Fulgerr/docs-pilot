# New field for HashiCorp Vault

The HashiCorp Vault and HashiCorp Vault (read only) credential stores are
            now enhanced with the new and optional Authentication Mount Path field. This
            allows you to specify a custom mount path, and mount the same authentication method with
            two different configurations, on two distinct paths.
