### User and group profiles

# Unified profiles for audit and troubleshooting

We are happy to announce that we have introduced a unified view where you can check and manage all the necessary information about your user accounts and local groups. We refer to this view as user and group profiles.

User and group profiles are the solution you need to easily audit and troubleshoot your user or group configurations. Unlike before, you can now perform a wide array of operations from one single location: customize group memberships, handle licenses, monitor access, and update user and group info.

Currently, user and group profiles are available for Organization Admins only.

# How to use user and group profiles

To access user and group profiles, navigate to Admin > Accounts & local groups, choose either the User accounts or the Local groups tab, then select the user account or local group you want to manage. A new window opens, allowing you to view or update your user or group configurations.

The following image shows some of the options you have for managing user profiles:



# What's next

The new user and group profile experience is enabled by default. However, to facilitate a smooth transition, the previous user and group experience will continue to be available for a limited period, after which we will phase it out. During this period, you have the flexibility to switch between the classic and the new experience as per your comfort.

To switch between the old and new experience, use the toggle button in the upper right side of the Accounts & local groups page, as shown in the following image:

### Introducing the tenant administrator role

# First cross-service role

We are excited to announce the Tenant Administrator role in Automation Suite.

This new cross-service role enables you to delegate responsibilities more efficiently by designating users, groups, robot accounts, or external applications to manage all resources within a given tenant.

You can now delegate tasks such as role assignment, licensing management, service provisioning, and more, to a Tenant Administrator without worrying about them having access to any other resources within your organization.

Ideal for RPA CoE Directors and IT Administrators, the Tenant Administrator role allows reassigning some tasks from an Organization Administrator to a tenant-level role.

# Benefits of the Tenant Administrator role

If you are curious about the benefits of the new Tenant Administrator role, here they are:

* Enhanced operational efficiency: This new role reduces the time required to set up the admin for tenant-level operations;
* Reduced workload for Organization Administrators: It eases the burden on the Organization Administrators;
* Improved security: Since fewer users have maximum permissions, there is greater control on access rights.

You will be pleased to learn that the Tenant Administrator role is just the first tenant-level role we plan to introduce. Our goal is to allow you to manage cross-service roles from a central location.

# Known limitations

The Tenant Administrator role is currently affected by the following known limitations, which we are actively working on overcoming:

* Only the following services support the Tenant Administrator role: Orchestrator (includes Actions, Processes, Integration Service), Data Service, Document Understanding, Task Mining, Test Manager. The rest of the tenant-level services are currently not supported, and users with only the Tenant Administrator role cannot access these services.
* The Tenant Administrator cannot access organization-level menus from the interface.
* On the Admin > Tenants > Services screen, the Tenant Administrator can view enabled services, but cannot add or remove services.
* On the Admin > Tenants > Manage access screen, the Tenant Administrator can view tenants they do not administer. However, if the Tenant Administrator accesses these tenants, they cannot perform any actions.

For more details on the new Tenant Administrator role and how to assign it, refer to Tenant-level roles.


### Checking access at tenant level

In an attempt to streamline your administrative tasks, we now offer improved visibility and control over roles and permissions at both service and tenant levels.

If you are an Organization Administrator or Tenant Administrator, you can now have a comprehensive view of the roles and permissions for users, groups, robot accounts, or external applications within a tenant or service.

You can access the feature by navigating to Admin > Manage access > Check access. Here, you can search for the account you are interested in and review its roles and permissions.

Here are some of the benefits of the feature:

* Quick and efficient resolution of access control issues
* Simplified auditing of roles and permissions
* Increased overall efficiency for administrators

For more details, refer to Checking access.


## Licensing




### Improved tenant-level license tracking and assignment

You can now monitor the quantity of runtimes that are currently in use by a tenant, in addition to the number of licenses that are available for allocation. You can check this new value in the Edit license allocation panel for the selected tenant, by choosing the Licenses card in the Admin section.

This new feature helps you avoid the re-assignment of licenses already in use, by making it easier to count and assign the remaining licenses. For details, refer to License overallocation. For details, refer to License overallocation.

The following image shows the Edit license allocation panel, where you can view the number of both available and in-use licenses.
