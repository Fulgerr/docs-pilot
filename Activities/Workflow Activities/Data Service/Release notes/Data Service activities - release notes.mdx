# Data Service activities - release notes

View the release notes for the pre 24.10 Data Service activity package.

### v24.7.1

Release date: 6 August 2024

# Improvements

Previously, the dropdown menu did not display Entities which were relevant to the activity. This occurred to activities without custom fields, and to file activities without file fields.

Such Entities are now visible in the dropdown menu. When you select an invalid entity, a validation error message displays, and indicates what you should fix in your Entity.

# Known issues

The validation error message does not appear in the current version of Studio Desktop. It works as expected in Studio Web.


### v23.10.0

Release date: 24 October 2023

# Bug fixes

Assigning variables to the Output Records property of the Create multiple entity records activity used to return null, but this issue has been resolved.


### v23.4.1

Release date: 8 June 2023

The Field input of activities that manage files (upload, delete, or download) now displays all the file fields of the selected entity in a dropdown.
