                        list of codes for each character encoding on the Supported Character Encoding page.
                        To specify the encoding type to be used, use the value from the Name
                        field. If no encoding type is specified, the activity will search for the
                        file's Byte Order Marks to detect the encoding. If no Byte Order Marks are
                        detected, the system ANSI code page is selected by default.timeoutMSInt32Specifies the amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait for the activity to
                        run before an error is thrown. The default value is 30000 milliseconds (30
                        seconds).
