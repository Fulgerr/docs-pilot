                        a criterion for the prioritization of queue items, alongside Priority
                        and Postpone. This parameter can be filled in with relative dates
                        such as DateTime.Now.AddHours(2),
                            DateTime.Now.AddDays(10) and

                        Additionally, you can use the US notation to add an exact time, such as
                            12/10/2017 07:40:00. Automatically correcting this date
                        is available. For example, if you write 8 9 2018 9:0, it is
                        automatically transformed to 08/09/2018 09:00:00.itemInformationCollectionDictionaryString, ObjectEnables importing an entire dictionary of information for a queue item.deferDateDateTimeThe date after which the queue item may be processed. This parameter is a

                            dueDate and deferDate.referenceStringThe reference of the added QueueItem. The reference can be used to link your
                        transactions to other applications used within an automation project.
                        Additionally, this feature enables you to search for certain transactions,

                        run before an error is thrown. The default value is 30000 milliseconds (30
                        seconds).
