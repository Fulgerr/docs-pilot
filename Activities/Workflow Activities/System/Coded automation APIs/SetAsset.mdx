# SetAsset

Enables you to update the value of an indicated asset, which is already available in
            Orchestrator, be it a global or a Per Robot asset. Note that to execute this method,
                the Robot role needs to have Edit
            permissions on assets. When the UiPath.Core.Activities.SetAsset is
            triggered, the authentication context of the Robot under which it runs is being
            used.

For more information about Global and Per Robot assets, please see steps 5 and 6 from
                this page.
