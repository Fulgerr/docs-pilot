textStringThe text to be written into the file.fileILocalResourceThe file to write to. You can choose to configure the file either as an
                            IResource or Local File. If you choose
                        to use a local file, you need to add just the file name and extension and

                        each character encoding here. To specify the encoding type
                        to be used, use the value from the Name field. If no encoding type is
                        specified, the activity will search for the file's Byte Order Marks to
                        detect the encoding. If no Byte Order Marks are detected, the system ANSI
                        code page is selected by default.
