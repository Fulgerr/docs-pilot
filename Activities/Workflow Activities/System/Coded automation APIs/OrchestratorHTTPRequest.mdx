# OrchestratorHTTPRequest

Performs HTTP requests to the Orchestrator API by authenticating under the Robot it is executed on. You can use the GET, POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE verbs to extract data or manipulate it, and send specific information through JSON.

Note that for each request you might need different rights on the Orchestrator Robot role, depending on what requests you are doing, and the Robot has to be connected to Orchestrator. For example, to run PUT requests on organization units, you need View, Create, and Edit permissions. The method runs under the Robot which executes it.
