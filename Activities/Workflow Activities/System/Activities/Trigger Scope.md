# Trigger Scope

UiPath.Core.Activities.TriggerScope

Define actions that are triggered by various events.

# Interface

The activity interface is composed of the Triggers and Actions containers. This allows to define a set of triggers in the first, followed by a sequence of activities to execute based on trigger response.

The Triggers container only supports User Events activities.

In the Actions container, you can define TriggerArgs to be used in the next activity sequence. Please note that, in order to interrupt the Trigger Scope activity handling sequence, the Break activity should be used. This allows the workflow to continue execution as intended.

# Properties

Common

* ContinueOnError - Specifies if the automation should continue even when the activity throws an error. This field only supports Boolean values (True, False). The default value is False. As a result, if the field is blank and an error is thrown, the execution of the project stops. If the value is set to True, the execution of the project continues regardless of any error.If this activity is included in Try Catch and the value of the ContinueOnError property is True, no error is caught when the project is executed.
* DisplayName - The display name of the activity.

Misc

* Private - If selected, the values of variables and arguments are no longer logged at Verbose level.

Options

* Scheduling Mode - Specifies how to execute actions when a trigger is fired. The following options are available:If a trigger is received while a process is paused, it fires after the process resumes.
