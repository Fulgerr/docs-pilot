UiPath.Core.Activities.ForEachFolderX

Executes an activity or a series of activities for each child folder in a specified folder. Use this activity when you are working with child folders in a parent folder and you want to repeat one or more activities for each individual child folder. Add the activities to repeat inside For Each Folder in Folder and, when you configure the activities, select the file property to use for each folder from the CurrentFolder entry in the Plus menu.

# Configuring the Activity

Alternatively, you can click Plus on the right side of the field and then, from the menu, choose one of the available options to indicate the folder path:Data from the Project Notebook, a parent Excel file or Outlook account.

Use Saved Value - Select a value in the form of a folder path that you previously saved for later use in the project. Text - Enter a folder path in the Text Builder. You can combine text with a formula from an Excel file cell, for example to add a date to the folder name using formulas in the Project Notebook. Ask when run - Prompt for a folder path when the project is executed. Open in Advanced Editor - Enter a VB expression.
* Include subfolders - If selected, also executes the activities on the folders found in the child folders of the specified location. This option is not selected by default.

You can order the folders by name, created date, last updated date, and size, either ascending or descending.If an error occurs due to the activity encountering a folder with limited access for the current user, selecting the Skip option in the error dialog skips the entire activity, not the folder with limited access.
