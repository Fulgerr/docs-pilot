# Get Transaction Item

UiPath.Core.Activities.GetQueueItem

# Description

Gets an item from the Orchestrator queue so that you can process it (start the transaction) and sets its status to In Progress. Starting its processing makes it a transaction.

Please note that to execute this activity, the Robot role needs to have Edit permissions on queues. The activity runs under the Robot which executes it.

If the queue is empty, the following error is thrown upon accessing the retrieved TransactionItem: System.Exception: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.

* Orchestrator folder path - The path of the folder where the specified queue is located, if different from the folder where the process is running. This field only supports string values, with / as the separator to indicate subfolders. For example "Finance/Accounts Payable".The Orchestrator FolderPath parameter does not work for processes executed by robots in classic folders. Only robots in modern folders have the ability to pass data outside of their folder.Relative folder paths are supported in an X-UIPATH-FolderPath-Encoded header, as follows:Path starting with / - starts from the root folder of the tree the ambient folder is part of.Path starting with / - starts from the root folder of the tree the ambient folder is part of.Path starting with . - starts from the ambient folder.Path starting with .. - starts one level up in the hierarchy of the ambient folder for each .. in the path (e.g. ../ for one level up, ../../ for two levels up in the hierarchy).Trailing slashes are not accepted.
* Queue name - The queue where the QueueItem object is to be added. The name is case insensitive, meaning that if in Orchestrator it was defined as "MyFirstQueue", it matches "myfirstqueue". To manage the queues in your Orchestrator folders , select Manage queues.





Advanced options

Options

* Filter Strategy - The strategy to use when filtering according to reference. The following options are available:StartWith - looks for items whose references start with the value indicated in the Reference field. Equals - looks for items whose references are the same as the value indicated in the Reference field.
* Reference - Filters items according to their reference.
* Timeout (milliseconds) - Specifies the amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait for the activity to run before an error is thrown. The default value is 30000 milliseconds (30 seconds).
* Continue On Error - Specifies if the automation should continue even when the activity throws an error. This field only supports Boolean values (true, false). The default value is false. As a result, if the field is not configured and an error is thrown, the execution of the project stops. If the value is set to true, the execution of the project continues regardless of any error.

Output

* Transaction Item - The retrieved Transaction Item, stored in a QueueItem variable.
* Specific Data - This property becomes available for queues that have a schema definition. Allows you to access the properties from the Specific Content schema of the queue.If a new schema version has been applied to the queue, click Refresh to retrieve the latest changes.
