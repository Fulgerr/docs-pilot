# Get Jobs

UiPath.Core.Activities.GetJobs

# Description

Retrieves a list of Orchestrator jobs according to a custom filter, using the Orchestrator API. You can also specify the number of jobs to skip and/or the maximum number of jobs to retrieve. Please note that in order to execute this activity in Studio, the Robot has to be connected to Orchestrator and the Robot role needs the View right on jobs, processes, and environments. The activity runs under the Robot which executes it.

* Orchestrator folder path - The path of the folder from which the jobs should be retrieved, if different from the folder where the process is running. This field only supports string values, with / as the separator to indicate subfolders. For example "Finance/Accounts Payable".The Folder Path parameter does not work for processes executed by robots in classic folders. Only robots in modern folders have the ability to pass data outside of their folder.Relative folder paths are supported in an X-UIPATH-FolderPath-Encoded header, as follows:Path starting with / - starts from the root folder of the tree the ambient folder is part of.Path starting with . - starts from the ambient folder.Path starting with .. - starts one level up in the hierarchy of the ambient folder for each .. in the path (e.g. ../ for one level up, ../../ for two levels up in the hierarchy).Trailing slashes are not accepted.
* Filter - Specifies the OData filter to get jobs (i.e. CreationTime gt 2017-01-01T00:03:08.93Z and State eq 'Running'). For more references, check the OData Documentation. This property supports only strings or String variables. When the filter is used instead of an expression, you can configure it using the available wizard.

Misc

* Skip - Helps you skip the first "n" jobs. This property supports only integers and integer variables.
* Top - Returns only a specified number of jobs out of the total. The maximum value is 100. This property supports only integers and Integer variables.
* Timeout (milliseconds) - Specifies the amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait for the activity to run before an error is thrown. The default value is 30000 milliseconds (30 seconds).
* Continue On Error - Specifies if the automation should continue even when the activity throws an error. This field only supports Boolean values (True, False). The default value is False. As a result, if the field is blank and an error is thrown, the execution of the project stops. If the value is set to True, the execution of the project continues regardless of any error.

Output

* Jobs - The retrieved jobs, as an IEnumerable<OrchestratorJobs> variable.
