# Set Task Status

UiPath.Core.Activities.ProcessTracking.SetTaskStatus

# Description

The Set Task Status activity allows you to explicitly control the ending of a specific task within a Process Tracking Scope. It enables accurate representation of individual steps completion in analytics.

The Set Task Status activity is useful when you need to assign a status that differs from the implicit Successful or error-triggered Failed states. This might depend on your workflow-logic.

For instance, in a document processing workflow, a task verifies that all documents exist. If a document is missing, use Set Task Status to mark the status as Cancelled. Follow-up actions could include sending a revision request to the expeditor.
