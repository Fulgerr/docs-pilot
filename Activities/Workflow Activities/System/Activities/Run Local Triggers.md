# Run Local Triggers

UiPath.Core.Activities.StartTriggers

# Description

Starts all local triggers that listen for events on the user's machine. When executed, the activity generates a parallel process with all the triggers invoked (TriggerEventArgs).

You can use it inside a workflow, or invoke it from a different workflow using the Invoke workflow file activity.

No activity placed after Run Local Triggers executes until you add a  activity in your project.

You can use this activity and all triggers for both attended and unattended automations.
