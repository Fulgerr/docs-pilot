# Workflow Placeholder

UiPath.Core.Activities.Placeholder

# Description

This activity can only be used as a placeholder inside an Execution Template.
                After you set an execution template on a test case and you run it, this activity is
                replaced at runtime with an Invoke activity, which invokes the test case for
                which the execution template was set. Since Execution Templates act as wrappers for test
                cases, the Workflow Placeholder activity is a replacement for the test case
                that will be invoked at runtime.
