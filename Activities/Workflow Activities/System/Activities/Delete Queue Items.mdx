# Delete Queue Items

UiPath.Core.Activities.DeleteQueueItems

# Description

Enables you to delete items with the New state from a specified Orchestrator queue. Please note that in order to execute this activity in Studio, the Robot has to be connected to Orchestrator and the Robot role needs Edit, Create, and Delete permissions on queues and Delete permissions on transactions. When this activity is run, it uses the same authentication context as the Robot which executes it, inheriting its permissions.

* Timeout (milliseconds) - Specifies the amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait for the activity to run before an error is thrown. The default value is 30000 milliseconds (30 seconds).
* Continue On Error - Specifies if the automation should continue even when the activity throws an error. This field only supports Boolean values (true, false). The default value is false. As a result, if the field is not configured and an error is thrown, the execution of the project stops. If the value is set to true, the execution of the project continues regardless of any error.

Input

* Queue Items - The list of items that you want to mark as deleted in Orchestrator. They must be in the 'New' state and should be retrieved via a Get Queue Items activity first. This property supports only IEnumerable<QueueItem> variables.

Misc

* Folder Path - The path of the folder where the specified QueueItems are located, if different from the folder where the process is running. This field only supports string values, with / as the separator to indicate subfolders. For example "Finance/Accounts Payable".The FolderPath parameter does not work for processes executed by robots in classic folders. Only robots in modern folders have the ability to pass data outside of their folder.Relative folder paths are supported in an X-UIPATH-FolderPath-Encoded header, as follows:-right: Path starting with / - starts from the root folder of the tree the ambient folder is part of.-right: Path starting with . - starts from the ambient folder.-right: Path starting with .. - starts one level up in the hierarchy of the ambient folder for each .. in the path (e.g. ../ for one level up, ../../ for two levels up in the hierarchy).Note that trailing slashes are not accepted.
* Private - If selected, the values of variables and arguments are no longer logged at Verbose level.
