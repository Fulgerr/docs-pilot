* In - A collection of items to iterate over. This field supports only IEnumerable values.

Body

* Activities placed inside are executed if the condition is true.

Show additional properties

Item name - The name by which to refer to the current item in the iteration. Using a name that describes the item makes it easier to identify.The value of the In field must be a collection of homogenous objects.Argument type - A dropdown list that enables you to choose what variable type you want to use with the activity.Condition - If the condition is true, the Body of the activity is executed.Max Iterations - Maximum number of times the activity is executed.Index - A zero-based index that specifies which element of the current collection is being iterated, stored in an Int32 variable.

# Example of using the For Each Activity

For this example, we use a simple IEnumerable variable comprised of three elements, displaying each of them in a Message Box:

1. Create a new Process and drag a For Each activity into the workflow designer.
2. From the Variables panel, create a new IEnumerable variable, called List with the following value:{"one", "two", "three"}
3. Insert the List variable in the Values property of the For Each activity.
4. Drag a Message Box activity into the Body section of the For Each activity.
5. Insert the item iterator variable into the Text property field of the Message Box activity.
6. Run the file. The For Each activity iterates through each of the values specified in the List variable and displays it in a separate message box.
