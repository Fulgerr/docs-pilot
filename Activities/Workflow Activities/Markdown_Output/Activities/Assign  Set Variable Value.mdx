Allocates any value to a variable or argument. It can be used to increment the value of a

                chapter), sum up the value of two or more variables and assign the
            result to a different variable (see the example in the Generic Value Variables
                    chapter), assign values to an array (see the Array Variables
                chapter) and so on. By default, this activity is also included in the
                Favorites group.
