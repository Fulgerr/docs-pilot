# About the Testing activity package

The Testing Activity package includes tools that enable you to easily verify the systems you are testing.

Our support for RPA Testing does not only let you easily create automated Test Cases for your RPA workflows, it also introduces Activity Coverage, showing you how much of your RPA workflow is covered by the Test cases, as an previously unseen feature in the RPA world.

To create automated tests, choose one of the following experiences:

* Low-code - Use low-code automations paired with Testing Activities .
* Coded - Use coded automations, paired with Testing
                    coded automation APIs .

# AI Units or Platform units
                consumption

Certain activities or coded automation APIs in the Testing.Activities package require
                service units to be purchased, in order for them to run. Depending on the licensing
                plan you enrolled in, some features in the Testing.Activities package require you to
                purchase one of the following:For the Flex licensing plan,
                        you need AI units.For more information on AI units visit AI Units. For the Unified Pricing
                        licensing plan, you need Platform units.For more information on Platform
                            units, visit Platform units.Check the following list for the exact activities and APIs that can consume
                service units, and under what conditions:Activities:Coded automation APIs:

The activites and coded automation APIs that verify the equivalence of texts or
                documents consume one service unit (AI unit or Platform unit) per execution, which
                includes design time and runtime executions.

AI units or Platform units consumption, associated to the use of some Testing
                activities or coded automation APIs, is displayed in Automation Cloud Admin, on the
                    Consumables tab of the organization and tenant-level Licensing
                page. This means that you have access to the number of AI units or Platform units
                consumed per month, as well as in total for the duration of your plan.
