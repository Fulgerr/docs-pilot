# Handle Apps Request

UiPath.AppEvents.Activities.HandleAppRequest

# Description

Use the Handle Apps Request activity to process data received from the Apps Request Trigger activity and to invoke the relevant workflow files with the output payload. Upon completion, this activity sends the results back to UiPath Apps via RobotJS.

Consider the following conditions when you design the an app-triggered project:

* Use UiPath Studio version 2023.4 and above.
* Use UiPath Robot version 2023.4 and above.
* Use only Windows projects.
* Always use the Handle Apps Request activity in the Else section of an If activity. The If activity must come after the Apps Request Trigger activity.
* The Handle Apps Request activity must be used together with the Apps Request Trigger activity. UiPath Studio bundles these two activities into a template. Use the template to quick-start your app-triggered workflow.
* You must catch the case of losing the connection with the app (for example, the user closes the browser) in an If activity.



# How the Handle Apps Request activity works:

1. The Apps Request Trigger activity uses the TriggerEventArgs argument to send workflow payload to the Handle Apps Request activity.
2. Once it receives the payload, the Handle Apps Request activity sends it further to UiPath Robot, which uses the information to execute the workflow.
3. When UiPath Robot completes the workflow execution, it sends back the result to the Apps client via RobotJS IPC channel.
