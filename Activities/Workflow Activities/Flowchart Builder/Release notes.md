## v1.0.3

Release date: May 5, 2025

A new activity joins the pack! With Detached Error Handler, you can define global, reusable error recovery steps for your entire workflow, instead of handling errors task by task. Multiple Detached Error Handlers can be added for different exceptions.


## v1.0.1

Release date: February 26, 2025

The new Flowchart Builder activity package is here to help you model, optimize, and standardize process flows in your organization. With a collection of most used BPMN elements, such as Decision, Task, or Boundary Events, our activities offer integration with UiPath existing activities to create the blue-print of your long running workflows. Further, your business process design brings visibility into your task flows, highlighting bottlenecks or delays, for the greater scope of an optimal and efficient workflow.

The activity package comes bundled in the Long Running Automation template from UiPath Studio. To access the template and the Flowchart Builder experience, make sure you're using Studio version 2024.10+.
