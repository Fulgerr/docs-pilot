# Message Intermediate Catch Event

The Message Intermediate Catch Event pauses the process and waits for a specific event of an external system to complete.

The activity creates a subscription to an API event and listens for configured events from:

* Integration Service (records in SAP Concur, employee updates in Workday) activities
* Microsoft 365 (emails received, spreadsheets updated, calendar events) activities
* Google Workspace (emails received, spreadsheets updated, calendar events) activities
* Wait for Queue Item and Resume activity from the Persistence package

The Receive Task activity is recommended for workflows that rely on real-time interactions, such as waiting for external approvals, or system-generated updates.
