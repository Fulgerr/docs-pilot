Release date: October 14, 2020

# New features and improvements

The new Inter Process Communication activity package contains two new activities, Broadcast Message and Message Receiver Trigger, that aid parallel processes running on multiple threads in communicating with each other. This pack is meant to be used for advanced business logic where you need to define specific channels through which you can send and receive messages from a process to another, thus letting you know when certain parts of parallel processes have finished executing.
