# Set Form Values

UiPath.Forms.Activities.SetFormFieldsActivity

# Description

Use this activity to change the values of a form at runtime, while the form is still
                showing, and the user is interacting with it. The way you change the values of a
                form is by adding key-value pairs inside the activity, where Key is
                the Property Name of the form component that you want to change, and
                    Value is the value you want to assign.

                            Form - Select the form file that you want to display.Arguments - a collection of key - value pairs,
                        where Key is the Property Name of a form component and
                            Value is the data you want to assign to a form component. You can
                        use this collection to change the value of a form component at runtime,
                        while the form is still showing, and the user is interacting with it. In the
                            Value field you can also pass global variables.

                        from a specific form instance, type the corresponding name of the instance
                        here. If you want to change the values for all form instances, leave this
                        field empty.
