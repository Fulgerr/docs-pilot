# Form Event Trigger

UiPath.Forms.Activities.FormTriggerActivity<UiPath.Forms.Activities.FormInfoTriggerEventArgs>

# Description

You can use this activity to trigger workflows based on an event happening inside a
                form. For example, you can choose to trigger a workflow when a form is closed, loses
                focus, or when a certain button was clicked, or a certain text field changed. If you
                have the Form Trigger Activity in any of your workflows, after you run the
                project, an argument named TriggerEventArgs, of type
                    TextTriggerEventArgs appears in the Arguments panel.

This trigger activity must be the first activity in the workflow.You can only use one trigger activity per workflow.

# Configuration

Designer panelSelect Form - Select the form file based on which you want to create
                        a trigger. You can either choose an existent form file, or click
                            Create new form and start building a form
                        file.Event - Select the event in the form based on which you want the
                        trigger to start. The default form events are: Form closedForm focus lostForm focus gainedForm state changed (minimzed/restored)According to the form file you selected for Select
                                    Form, other events specific to the form components
                                used in the form file show up.For example, for Button
                                    components, form events such as Button clicked
                                    appear.Message
                            ID - The ID of the message sent from the form using
                            uipathApi.sendMessage. You need this property only if
                        you want to create a trigger for a custom HTML form.When you pass data
                            through the Message ID property, you are sending form events. For
                                uiform files, pre-defined form events are available. However,
                            for HTML forms, you must create the form events using the
                                uipathApi.sendMessage JavaScript function. The
                            process requires creating a form event, such as "Reject clicked",
                            within the HTML file. To create a trigger for this event, you must
                            specify the event name in the Message ID property. For more
                            information see .

Properties panelEnabled - When
                            Enabled is On, the trigger starts when the chosen form
                        event happens. When Enabled is Off, the trigger starts only if
                        you explicitly enable it using the Enable trigger activity.Trigger ID - The
                        unique identifier of this trigger. The Trigger ID can be used with
                        other activities, such as Repeat trigger.Instance Name - If you
                        want to run the trigger only on an instance of a form file, input the
                        instance name in this field. If you want to run the trigger for all
                        instances of a form, leave this field empty.
