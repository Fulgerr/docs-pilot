background-color:red;

                    the classes added at step 1 inside the Custom CSS Class
                    field.For this example, edit a Text Field component,
                            and paste the change CSS class inside the
                                Custom CSS Class field.Watch the component turn red after saving it.Edit a Text Area component, and paste the
