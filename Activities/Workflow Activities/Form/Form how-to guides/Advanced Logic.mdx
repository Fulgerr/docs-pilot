# Advanced Logic

Before you begin, learn about Advanced
                Logic.Generally, to configure an advanced logic:

Open or create a Form file in Studio.Add components into your form. Pay attention to their Property Names, as
                    you might use those in your advanced logic.Navigate to the Logic tab of the component you want to change (i.e., the
                    component upon which the action should take place).Click +Add Logic. You can add as many logics as you want.Enter a name for your logic.In the Trigger pane, select the type of trigger you want to use in your
                    logic. The available types are Simple, Javascript, JSON
                        Logic, and Event. Set the desired conditions to trigger the
                    action.In the Action pane, click +Add Action. You can add as many
                    actions as you want, all triggered by the logic that groups them.Enter a name for your action.Select the type of action you want to use. The available types are
                        Property, Value, Merge Component Schema, and Custom
                        Action. Set the desired effect of your action.To save your logic, click Save Logic..

The above procedure applies generically to any type of trigger or action. For a
                detailed procedure, check out the specific tutorials, which provide examples of each
                specific trigger and action type:Trigger type: Javascript & Action type: Value. Visit
                            Trigger type: Simple & Action type: Property. Visit Trigger type: Simple & Action type: Merge Component
                            Schema. Visit Before you follow the tutorials, see the sample forms here.

### Summing up two text fields dynamically

Trigger type: JavaScript Action type:
                ValueThis advanced logic sums up two text fields, based on the condition
                that the user interacts with the corresponding text fields.

# Untitled Section

At runtime, if the business user interacts with text fields A and
                    B, the Total field gets automatically filled
                in, displaying the sum of A and B.

Open or create a Form file in Studio.Add three Text Field components into your form.Name two of the text field components as A and
                        B, and name the third one as Total. Pay
                    attention to their Property Names, as you use those in your advanced
                    logic.Optionally, you can set the Total text field component as
                        Disabled, so business users cannot interact with it.Go to the Logic tab of the Total field component.
                Add a logic and name it "dynamic sum". Select the Javascript trigger type, and enter the following script in
                    the Text Area section:result = true;
return result;The above snippet detects if there are any changes in the text fields,
                    i.e., the user interacts with the text fields, and triggers the action to sum up
                    the fields.Add an action and name it "a+b".Select the Value action type, and enter the following script in the
                        Value (Javascript) section:result = (+data.a) + (+data.b);
return result;Replace a and b with the field keys
                    values of the text field components.Save the action and the logic.Save the component.


### Hiding a field dynamically

Trigger type: Simple Action type:
                PropertyThis advanced logic hides a form field (i.e., the Child
                    field) when the user inputs "hide" in another form field (i.e.,
                    Parent field).

Open or create a Form file in Studio.Add two Text Field components.Name one of the text field components as Parent field, and the
                    other one as Child field. Pay attention to their Property
                        Names, as you use those in your advanced logic.Go to the Logic tab of the Child field component.Add a logic and name it "hide input".Select the Simple trigger type.From the When the form component dropdown menu, select
                                Parent field ({parentField_property_name}).In the Has the value field, enter "hide".The above configuration detects if the user input the string
                                "hide" in the parent field and triggers the action
                            to hide the child field.Add an action and name it "hide". Select the Property action type.From the Component Property dropdown menu, select
                            Hidden.From the Set State dropdown menu, select True.Save the action and the logic.Save the component.

At runtime, if the business user inputs
                "hide" in the parent field, the child field becomes
            hidden.


### Changing the title color dynamically

Trigger type: Simple Action type: Merge
                Component SchemaThis advanced logic changes the label color of a text field
                component when the user select the desired color from a list. The change applies
                using a custom CSS file.

Prerequisites: Add the CSS classes containing the new
            color for the text field in the Custom CSS property field of the form.For example, the CSS snippet below contains a class that sets the label color
                to green or
                red:.textFieldLabel-green 
{
   color : green;
}
.textFieldLabel-red 
{
   color : red;
}After referencing the CSS classes in the Custom CSS
                property field, design your form following the steps below:

Add one Text Field component and one Radio component. Pay
                    attention to their Property Names, as you use those in your advanced
                    logic. In the Display tab of the text field component, set a default Custom
                        CSS Class. For example, to set red as the default color of the text
                    field, use the textFieldLabel-red class. The class must be
                    defined in the CSS file you created for the Prerequisites section.For the Radio component, add two values for the colors
                        green and red. Go to the Logic tab of the Text Field component. Add a logic and name it "color selection".Select the Simple trigger type. From the When the form component dropdown menu, select
                                Radio ({radio_field_key}).In the Has the value field, enter
                            "green".The above configuration detects if the user selects "green"
                    from the radio options and triggers the action to change the text field label
                    color.Add an action and name it "change color using css"Select the Merge Schema Component action type and enter the following
                    snippet:return { customClass: "textFieldLabel-green" }Save the action and the logic. Save the component.

At runtime, if the business user selects the
                "green" radio button, the label of the text field becomes green. If
            the user selects the "red" radio button, the label of the text field
            becomes red.
