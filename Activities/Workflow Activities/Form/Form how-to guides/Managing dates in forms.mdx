            set a minimum or maximum date, as well as restrict the user selection of specific
            dates.

For the Date/Time component you can make one or more specific dates
                unavailable for selection within the form, using the Disable specific dates or
                    dates by range property.

                    below:Go the Date tab of the component.Using the information under Custom Disabled Dates, write the dates
                        that you want to remove, in the specified formats.Additionally, if you want to disable either weekdays or weekends, you can

# Setting a relative date

To set a relative minimum or maximum date inside a Day/Time component, you can
                use the JavaScript library Moment.js. This library is already included and
                you can use it inside your forms.

For example, to set the minimum date 10 days prior to the current date, perform the
                following steps:

1. Go to the Validation tab of the Day/Time component.
2. Select Use Input to add moment.js for minDate.
3. In the Minimum Date field, input moment().substract(10,'days').

To set the maximum date 10 days after the current date, perform the following
                steps:

1. Select Use Input to add moment.js for maxDate.
2. In the Maximum Date field, input moment().add(10,'days').
