# Running forms using JavaScript

You can execute JavaScript while a form is displaying,
            using the 
            activity. This tutorial demonstrates how to display a simple JavaScript alert while a
            form is showing.To help you achieve your use case with
                JavaScript, don't forget to inspect the form elements at runtime using
                    DevTools. To open DevTools on a form, right-click inside the body
                of the form while it's showing, and click Inspect.

Create a Form file on top of which you want to execute JavaScript.
                Add a Show Form activity and select the form that you created at step 1,
                    and make sure that Continue Workflow Execution is
                    enabled.Add a 
                    activity and select the form that you created at step 1.Inside the Source property field, add the JavaScript
                    between double quotes " ".For this example, use the following JavaScript to show an alert on top of
                    the
                    form:"alert('You can now close the form!')"Run the workflow to display the form. Right-click inside the body of the form
                    at runtime, and then click Inspect. DevTools opens and you can inspect your custom JavaScript to
                    debug it.
