# Conditional components

To make your forms dynamic, you can use the
                Conditional tab of a form component. There you can apply
            conditions, that show up at runtime. You can apply two types of conditions:Simple conditionsAdvanced conditions

### Simple conditions

This tutorial demonstrates how to create simple conditions
            on a form component.

Open your Form file in Studio, and add components into your form.For this example, add the following components:Two Checkbox.A single Number.A single Text Field.Navigate to the Conditional tab of the Text Field component and
                    go to the Simple section.This component should Display - choose
                                True from the dropdown list. This creates the condition under
                            which the Text Field component displays. If you want to hide the
                            component, choose FalseWhen the form component - choose the Number component
                            from the dropdown list.Has the value - type in the value of the Number component
                            that conditions the Text Field to display.Save the component.

### Advanced conditions

This tutorial shows how to create advanced conditions on a
            form component.Advanced Conditions override
                Simple conditions.

Open your Form file in Studio, and add components into your form. You
                    can use the same form file that you used for trying out Simple
                    conditions.For this example, add the following components:Two Checkbox.One Number.A single Text Field.Navigate to the Conditional tab of the Number component.Click Advanced conditions and go to the JavaScript section.If you want to show the condition at runtime, start your condition with the
                        show boolean variable. Use the data
                    variable and the Property Name to access the data in other form
                    components.For this example, to display the Number component, you can type the
                        following script:show = (data.checkbox1 === true && data.checkbox === true)

If you want to hide a component under a condition, put an
                exclamation point ! after the equal = sign and
                before the condition.To see how the advanced condition behaves, watch the video
                    below:
