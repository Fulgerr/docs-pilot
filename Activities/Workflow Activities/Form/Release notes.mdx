# Release notes


## V23.10.10

Release date: June 3, 2025

We updated our common dependencies to the most recent versions. This upgrade is automatic
            and doesn't require any action from your side.


## V25.4.1

Release date: May 16 2025

# Bug fixes

Data within a DataTable form element was not visible when the DataTable was
                nested inside a Panel form element with the Collapsible option
                enabled.


## V25.2.1

Release date: March 11, 2025

# Improvements

With our recent update, you can now dynamically set values for form elements, such as
                Drop-down Lists, Checkboxes, or Radio components, accepting multiple values, even
                when operating on Studio 23.10.

This approach involves using the .Items suffix attached to the
                relevant argument within the Arguments dictionary. For example, if you are
                working with a Drop-down List element inside a form, the corresponding argument
                bonding data to this element gets automatically included in the activity's
                    Arguments dictionary. This argument will be a list of type string and
                will have .Items appended to it. This enables the passing of a list
                of strings as a value to the Drop-down List element. For instance, if your Drop-down
                List element has the groceryList field key, then
                    groceryList.Items will be automatically inserted in the
                    Arguments dictionary so you can bind data to it.

## V25.2.0

Release date: February 4, 2025

# Improvements

Now, when you use form elements that accept multiple values (such as Drop-down Lists,
                Checkboxes, or Radio components), you can dynamically set their values using the
                    .Items suffix attached to the corresponding argument within the
                    Arguments dictionary. Take a Drop-down List element inside a form as an
                example. The argument that binds data to this element will be automatically added to
                the activity's Arguments dictionary. This argument will be a list of type
                string and will have .Items appended to it. You can then pass a
                list of strings as a value to bind them to the Drop-down List element. For instance,
                if your Drop-down List element has a groceryList field key, the
                    groceryList.Items key will be automatically inserted into the
                    Arguments dictionary.

## V2.0.8

Release date: November 15, 2024

# Bug fixes

Executing projects with Studio versions 2024.10.1 and higher failed due to an issue
                with the Microsoft.CodeAnalysis dependency.


## V24.10.5

Release date: 21 October 2024

# Improvements

* We've enhanced the Data Table component within Forms and Tabs by adding the Hidden parameter. Now you can easily control the visibility of the Data Table component using this parameter, which was previously missing despite being included in the Logic configuration.

# Bug fixes

* We've addressed an issue where you could not control the Data Table component visibility inside the Form or Tabs using the Hidden parameter. The Hidden parameter was absent even though the Logic configuration included this option.
* We've addressed an issue that was affecting the functionality of the Get Form Values and Set Form Values activities in our transition from version 2.0.3 to 23.4.6. This issue caused the Arguments input to lock when an existing Form file was chosen from the Select Form drop-down list. This was inconsistent with the Show Form activity that allowed adding extra arguments.

Release date: 27 April 2023

# Breaking change

The 23.4.3 version of the Form.Activities package causes a breaking change for workflows built with previous versions of Form.Activities (2.0.5 and lower).

If you want to reuse the workflows that you created with package versions 2.0.5 or lower, inside projects that use versions 23.4.3 or higher, you need to recreate them using the new activities.

# New form experience

We are excited to announce the general availability of our new and improved Form experience, now a part of our Trigger-based Attended Automation solution. Our current Form capabilities allow you to build complex forms, collect and process user or application input, and control the way they display using custom user and event triggers. With this release, we have added new activities, a revamped Form Builder, and custom HTML forms, allowing the creation of complex attended automations. You can now trigger events based on form events, such as a component changing or losing focus, and execute forms using custom JavaScript. Additionally, you can continue workflow execution while a form is still showing, edit and retrieve form values at runtime, and change the form layout properties at runtime.

Learn more about the new form experience in our documentation.

# New activities

A new form experience requires a new set of activities that allows you to cover all your attended scenarios. Here's what you can now achieve using the new activities:Create, edit, and delete forms independently from any activity, using a Form file.The Form file is created and built inside Studio.Display multiple forms, or instances of the same form, at the same time, using the  activity and the new trigger capabilities.Start triggers based on events taking place inside the form, using the .Retrieve and update form values at runtime, using the  and  activities.Change the properties of a form at runtime, using the  activity.Create forms using custom HTML files. Check out this tutorial to learn how to create your own custom HTML forms.Run your forms using custom JavaScript written inside the  activity.

# Getting started

* When using the UiPath.Form.Activities v.1.1.11 package, the digital signatures were missing from the UiPath.Callout.Activity.Design and UiPath.Callout DLL files.


## v2.0.2

Release date: 23 August 2022

To use the UiPath.Form.Activities v2.0.2 package, you need to have .NET Desktop Runtime 5.0 (x64) installed.

# What's New

With this release, the Callout Designer activity has moved into the UiPath.Callout.Activities activity pack. Learn more about the new activity pack in the Callout Activities pack guide.To continue using the Callout Designer activity, you need to:Install the UiPath.Callout.Activities v2.0.2 package.Install the UiPath.Form.Activities v2.0.2 package.If you have UiPath.Form.Activities v2.0.2 installed, but you do not have UiPath.Callout.Activities v2.0.2 installed, you get this error for the Callout Designer activity:Grid is a new, read-only component available in the Form Designer. The Grid component allows you to sort, filter and resize columns, as well as display column data on pages. You can drag and drop it from the Data section into your form. Editing the Grid component is planned for a future release. To learn more about grid controls, check the Comparison between grid control components table. Dev Tools is a new property available in the Create Form activity, for debugging and troubleshooting purposes. The Dev Tools property can also be used by developers to experiment with CSS styles. Learn more about this property in the Create Form activity guide.

# Improvements

* Improved keyboard accessibility when using the UiPath Form Designer.
* With this release, Buttons disable once you click them and the Do block starts running. The Allow multiple clicks while running do block option allows you to click a button multiple times while the Do block is running. If you leave the Allow multiple clicks while running do block option unselected, users cannot click the Button component until the Do block completes running.
* The Isolated property in the Create Form activity is now implicit, so the property has been removed. This property opens the forms in separate Windows processes.
* The processes of initializing forms and executing do blocks are significantly improved.

# Bug Fixes

* When you submitted a form with a Button of type Submit, the Dismissed output property was not set as expected.
* When the ExecuteDoBlockFirst property was selected, and the Do block was empty, the form kept running indefinitely. Now, the form stops running, as expected.
* When you used the UiPath Form Designer in Dark Mode, the text inside the Content component did not display, unless selected.
* In the Conditional tab of a form component, when you configured Simple conditions, the 'When the form component' drop-down list did not show all the components used by the form. Now the drop-down list is complete, as expected.
* When passing data from a Read Range activity into a form, using a grid component, the data retrieved from the inputted Excel file did not display in the grid. Now, the grid component is updated with the data passed from the Excel file, as expected.
* Fixed a bug that was causing high CPU and memory usage when adding a Callout Designer activity in the workflow, due to the spawning of multiple CefSharp processes.
* For projects in UiPath Studio that run with .NET Desktop Runtime 5.0 and are created outside the Documents directory, the Create Form activity did not work as expected. This behavior is fixed now.
* For Cross-platform projects in UiPath Studio, a runtime exception was generated when using the Create Form Task activity, from the Persistence.Activities package.

## v1.7.2

Release date: 10 March 2022

# Bug Fixes

* Form buttons allowed consecutive clicks, resulting in multiple Do block executions at the same time. To prevent this behavior, buttons are now disabled until the Do block execution finishes.


## v1.9.3

Release date: 07 March 2022

# Improvements

* The CefSharp bundle version has been upgraded to 1.7.0 - Preview.

# Bug Fixes

## v1.9.1

Release date: 08 February 2022

# Improvements

Starting with
            this version, the

UiPath.Form.Activities

package supports the

.NET5

framework for Windows.

# Known issues

If you try to install the UiPath.Form.Activities pack on machines without Visual C++ x64 runtimes, an error occurs:Cannot load assembly: ....\uipath.cefsharpbundle.netcore/1.6.0\lib/net5.0-windows/CefSharp.Core.dll : System.BadImageFormatException: Could not load file or assembly 'CefSharp.Core.Runtime, Version=92.0.260.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=40c4b6fc221f4138'. 
An attempt was made to load a program with an incorrect format.To prevent the error, install the Visual C++ x64 runtime from this source.


## v1.8.0

Release date: 22 December 2021

# Bug fixes

Placing the Create
                            Form activity right after a Start Form Activity (without any
                        intermediary activities) might have paused the workflow execution. We fixed
                        this behavior. We fixed a bug that was
                        causing real time forms to break if they were placed inside a loop workflow
                        (i.e., flowcharts). Selecting the
                            ExecuteDoBlockFirst checkbox works as designed now, and it
                        execute the activities in the Do block when the form opens. The Date/Time
                        component requires CDN access and didn't work as expected in offline
                        environments. We are now bundling the required files in the Form activity
                        package. Previously, assigning
                            null values to a Date/Time field did not clear
                        the existing values. We fixed this behavior.


## v1.7.1

Release date: 14 October 2021

* This Form activities pack gets upgraded with the latest version of the CefSharp dependency— UiPath.CefSharpBundle v1.6.0 —and uses UiPath.Telemetry.Client v1.5.3 .


## v1.7.0

Release date: 04 October 2021

# Features

* To trigger the execution of the Do block from an external process, use the newly released Trigger Form Button activity. The convenience of this feature is you no longer need the user intervention to click the form buttons. Just delegate this task to another process and watch Do blocks getting executed ;) .Learn the tips and tricks of this feature in the Trigger Form Button guide.

# Improvements

* You can output the ID of the process generating the form through the Output property of the Start Form activity. You can further use the form process ID in other activities, either in the same workflow or a different one.For more details, check out the Start Form activity guide.
* If you want to use your company icon for the forms windows, look no further, as the IconPath property of the Create Form activity allows you to do just that.Find out more in our documentation.

# Bug Fixes

* The Label/Header component got a couple of tweaks:Error messages for Field Keys containing spaces or invalid characters in the Form Designer. For missing field keys at runtime, the undefined message got replaced by an empty placeholder.


## v1.6.0

Release date: 13 September 2021

Two new Format properties are introduced with this release:

* DisableSanitize—which allows you to stop any sanity check on the form components. This translates to a faster rendering of the form. Recommended when the form contains trusted sources and URLs.
* Start Form As Minimized—which allows your form to be generated as a minimized window on the taskbar, without popping on the screen anymore. Just click the icon on the taskbar to maximize the form.


## v1.5.0

Release date: 23 August 2021

* A new activity joined the package, with a main purpose of improving productivity and time consumed. Check out the Start Form Activity and how to use it.
* You can now reset the data collected from the DO block with a click of a button. Learn how to do it in our tutorial .
* Other than the above mentioned features, this version clears several bugs and improves performance.


## v1.4.0

Release date: 4 August 2021

* This version includes various stability and performance fixes.
* A new functionality has been added to the Button component: update your forms with a button click, without executing the Do block of the Create Form activity. Learn more from our tutorial.


## v1.3.0

Release date: 12 July 2021

Be sure when you commit to the
                UiPath.Form.Activities package v1.3.0 and the features it brings, as
            it is not backward compatible to lower versions.

                reset functionality to the Button component.

Restrict the type of files available to the end user selection by adding specific
                file extensions in the File / Folder path component.

Your requests to use a local CSS file to customize forms have been listened. In this
                activity version we deliver a new Format property field allowing you to

                on. Read our tutorial to find out how.

You are now able to set a minimum or a maximum date for your Date / Time
                component of your form. Also, with the new functionality, you can make unavailable
                for selection specific dates, weekends, or weekdays. Make sure to check out our tutorial for more
                information.

Drop-down labels longer than 65 characters can be displayed when you search for them
                using a string section beyond the 65th character. To learn more, read our tutorial.

You can now clear date fields in your form and save them like that.

To turn on autofocus for Text Area component, open the corresponding
                    Component JSON and add the following key-value pair:
                    "autofocus":"true".

File or folder paths now support white spaces.

Render images or PDF files dynamically, by setting their paths as variables in the
                    FormFieldsCollection field.

                activities from the Do block. Find out more details in our tutorial.

Narrow or widen columns in tables in Grid components as you need, by tweaking
                the Header and Row Templates. Learn how to do it from our tutorial.

# Bug fixes

* The strings you enter in the first Value field of a Select Boxes component > Data tab are no longer switched to camelCase.
* We fixed a bug causing the drop-down Values you set in the Data tab of a Drop-down List component to revert to default (the name of the label in camelCase).
* Rendered forms may result as blank, and even after maximizing the form window, you cannot interact with the UI elements. This behavior is caused by the active hardware acceleration on applications that use Windows Presentation Foundation. To fix the issue, update your graphics driver.

# New features and
                improvements

The first iteration of the Form activity package contains a
                new activity that enables you to create and display custom form fields, which can be
                used to collect data from human users, and then be reused in your automation
                processes. The pack also contains activities that help you create customizable
                callouts, interactive information bubbles, which can be targeted on UI elements in
                the apps you are automating. The following activities are part of this activity
                pack:

* Create Form
* Callout Designer

Please note that in order to
                use the Callout activities, you need UIAutomation Activities v19.10.0
                or above.

The old Callout activity in
                the UI Automation package shall be renamed to Tooltip in the v19.10.0 release,
                to avoid confusion.
