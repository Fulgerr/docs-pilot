# Embedding Objects in Form Actions

You can design your Form Actions to display images or PDF files, to simply customize the look with logos and icons, or to provide materials that can help your Action Center users in completing the Action.

This feature is available with the Create Form Task activity only.

To embed objects, you use the properties under the Storage section of the Create Form Task activity to link to a Storage Bucket and the Upload Storage File activity to add files.

You can embed any type of object that is supported by storage buckets.

The video below shows how an embedded PDF file behaves in Action Center:
