# Take Screenshot

UiPath.UIAutomationNext.Activities.NTakeScreenshot

# 

Takes a screenshot of a specified UI element or application and saves it as an image file.



If added inside a Use Application/Browser
                activity, only the targeted application is captured. If added outside of an
                application card, since there is no target specified, the entire desktop is
                captured.

* Auto increment - Select what to append to the filename when saving the screenshot in case of filename conflicts. For example, if a file with the same name as the one you save already exists, choosing Index keeps the file name, creating a new file for each screenshot and adding an index number to each, consecutively.None (overwrite) - If a file with the same name already exists, replace it. Index - Add a number to the filename, for example screenshot (1).png. YYYY.MM.DD at HH.MM.SS - Add the date and time when the screenshot is taken to the filename, for example screenshot 2020.06.22 at 10:22:32.

* Auto increment - Defines what to append to the filename in case of filename conflicts. Choose an option from the drop-down menu:YYYY.MM.DD at HH.MM.SS - If one file with specified name already exists, a new file is created with name Filename YYYY.MM.DD at HH.MM.SS. If a file with filename Filename YYYY.MM.DD at HH.MM.SS already exists, and index is added, similar to the Index case, resulting in a file called Filename YYYY.MM.DD at HH.MM.SS (1).Index - If one or multiple files that match the pattern Filename (XX) already exists, a new file is created with name Filename (N+1), where N is the max index from the existing files.None (overwrite) - The filename will be exactly as specified, and in case another file with the same name already exists, it will be overwritten. This is the default option.
