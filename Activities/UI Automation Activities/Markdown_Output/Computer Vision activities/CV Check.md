* Descriptor - The on-screen coordinates of the Target and each Anchor that is used, if any. These values are stored in a CvDescriptor proprietary object. Once the Indicate On Screen feature is used at runtime, the CvDescriptor is automatically generated in this field and has the following structure:"Target: Image (14,61,105,54) OffsetPoint: (-10,-75)" + "Anchor: Text 'Anchor1' (41,36,19,9)" + "Anchor: Text 'Anchor2' (75,36,37,9)" +
* TimeoutMS - Specifies the amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait for the activity to run before an error is thrown. The default value is 30000 milliseconds (30 seconds).

* Action - Specifies the exact action that you want to perform. The following actions are available:Check - Select a check box. Uncheck - Clear a check box. Toggle - Switches the value of a check box. The changes are done based on the results of the Screen scan. In order to ensure the accuracy of an action, a refresh might be required before using the CV Check activity.

* CursorMotionType - Specifies the type of motion performed by the mouse cursor. There are two available options:Instant - The cursor jumps to the destination Smooth - The cursor moves gradually towards the destination. This option is suitable for elements that respond to interaction only when the mouse smoothly enters their area. Has no effect if SendWindowMessages or SimulateClick are enabled. By default, Instant is selected.

Reusable Region

* OutputRegion - Saves the target of this activity as a Rectangle variable. This enables you to pass the same target from one activity to another. Especially useful at design time, as it makes performing multiple actions on the same UI element easier.
