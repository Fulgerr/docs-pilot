# CV Refresh

UiPath.CV.Activities.CVRefresh

# 

Refreshes the scope, reflecting application state changes. The  button in the body
                of the activity can also be used to perform this action manually at design time. In
                order to minimize resource consumption, if the Refresh button is used in the
                designer, previously saved screens are checked by an algorithm and if they have not
                changed, the refresh call to the CV server is not done, and the old screen is
                used.

Starting with UI
                Automation v20.10.5, CV Screen Scope is no longer compatible with CV
                    Refresh due to the new caching strategy that enables CV Screen Scope
                to auto-refresh screens whenever necessary, so the CV Refresh activity has
                been deprecated.Starting with UI Automation v23.4, the CV Refresh activity is
                    hidden from the package and can no longer be used in new projects.
