# Click Images

The example below displays the automated interaction of a robot with a simple windows
            application by manipulating multiple images until creating a pattern. It presents
            activities such as Click Image, Double Click Image, or Wait Image
                Vanish. You can find these activities in the
                UiPath.UIAutomation.Activities package.

This is how the automation process can be built:

1. Open Studio and create a new
                        Process. Place the window application
                        inside the project folder. You can also use the one provided by us in the
                        downloadable example.Open the application before running the
                        workflow.
2. Drag a Sequence container in
                the Workflow Designer .
3. Drag a Wait Image Vanish
                    activity inside the Sequence container. Inside the activity, click
                        the Indicate image on screen option. Select the loading image like in
                        the following GIF: In the Properties
                        panel, add the value 45000 in the Timeout
                            (milliseconds) field.
4. Drag a Message Box activity
                    under the Wait Image Vanish activity. Add the expression
                            "Load Complete. Press OK to start" in the Text
                        field.
5. Drag an Attach Window
                    activity below the Message Box activity. Inside the activity, click
                        the Indicate image on screen option. Select the app image like in the
                        following GIF:
6. Drag a Click Image activity
                    inside the Body container of the Attach Window activity. Inside the activity, click
                            the Indicate element inside window option. Select the desired
                            element from the image, like in the following GIF: Using a Click
                                    Image activity clears a box, while using a Double Click
                                    Image activity, turns the box blue.Use as many
                                    Click Image and Double Click Image activities, as
                                needed, in order to create a specific pattern.
7. Run the process. The robot runs the
                Windows application and creates a pattern using blue images. For this example we're
                written Ui .
