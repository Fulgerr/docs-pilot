# Find Images

The example below explains how to identify the number of appearances of the same image
            under different names. It presents activities such as  and . You can find these
            activities in the UiPath.UIAutomation.Activities package.

This is how the automation process can be built:

1. Open Studio and create a new
                        Process. A simple web page with a
                    predefined design is needed in order to run this example. Make sure to
                    create/use your own web page or to use the one provided by us in the
                    downloadable example.
2. Drag a Sequence container
                    in the Workflow Designer and name it Count Errors. Create the following
                            variables:Variable NameVariable TypeDefault ValueCurrentDirectoryStringXMatchesSystem.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<UiPath.Core.UiElement>PagePathString
3. Drag a Sequence container
                inside the Count Errors container and name it Init PagePath .
4. Open the Init PagePath
                    sequence and add an Assign activity inside it. Add the variable
                            CurrentDirectory in the To field.Add the expression
                            Environment.CurrentDirectory in the Values
                        field.
5. Place another Assign
                    activity below the previous one. Add the variable
                            PagePath in the To field.Add the expression
                            Path.Combine(CurrentDirectory,"DemoPage","Table.html")
                        in the Values field.This is how your Init
                                PagePath sequence should look:
6. Return to the Main screen.
7. Drag an Open Browser
                    activity and place it below the Init PagePath sequence. Add the variable
                            PagePath in the Url field.
8. Select the Do container of
                    the Open Browser activity and create the following variables: Variable NameVariable TypeDefault valueType1ErrInt320Type2ErrInt320
9. Drag a Maximize Window activity inside the Do container.
10. Place a Click activity
                    under the Maximize Window activity. Inside the activity, click
                            the Indicate element inside browser option. Select the Allow
                                blocked content button like in the following gif:In the Properties
                        panel, add the value True in the ContinueOnError
                        field. Select the check box for the
                            SimulateClick option. By doing do, the click uses the technology
                        of the target application, this being the fastest method, that is also
                        working in the background. If neither this option, nor the
                            SelectWindowsMessages option are selected, then the click is
                        using the hardware method, which is the slowest and cannot run in the
                        background.
11. Drag a Find Image Matches
                    activity below the Click activity. Inside the activity, click
                            the Indicate screenshot inside browser option. Select the desired
                            button like in the following gif:In the Properties

                        the Message field.

19. Drag another Pick Branch activity inside the Pick activity, place it beside the previously added one
                and name it PickBranch Type2 .
20. Place a Find Image activity
