# About the AppSignatures package

Signatures for embedded browsers (such as WebView2, JxBrowser, Electron) change frequently, which may break existing automations. When the Enable WebView2 Native Automation project setting is used, target application updates can break the browser selectors generation.

Starting with v24.10, we decoupled the Electron detection logic into a separate package called UiPath.AppSignatures, which overrides current Chromium Native signatures from the Driver included in the UI Automation package.

# Configuring AppSignatures as a dependency in a project

To add the AppSignatures package to your project:

1. In Studio, open an existing project, or create a new one.Select Manage Packages.Search for the UiPath.AppSignatures package, and add it as a dependency to your project.
2. Select Project Settings, then UI Automation Classic.Select Browser, then set Enable WebView2 Native Automation to True.

# Deploying AppSignatures on a remote machine

To deploy the AppSignatures package to a Remote Desktop (RDP) environment:

1. Download the specific UiPath.AppSignatures package version which is used by your robot.
2. Extract the contents of UiPath.AppSignatures.<Major>.<Minor>.<Patch>.<Build>.nupkg\build\AppSignatures\* to C:\Program Files (x86)\UiPath\RemoteRuntime\packages\uipath.appsignatures\<Major>.<Minor>.<Patch>.<Build>\*.

# Updating AppSignatures

You can update the UiPath.AppSignatures package independently of the UiPath.UIAutomation.Activities package. You do not need to adjust and fully retest workflows before publishing them to production.

This means you can use the <html>/<webctrl> selectors for target applications, without the need to update to a new UI Automation package version when such target application updates occur.

# Known limitations

Keep in mind the following limitations when using the AppSignatures package:

* The AppSignatures package only supports projects which use UiPath.UIAutomation.Activities v24.10.6 or higher.
* AppSignatures supports Chromium Native and WebView2 Native signatures.AppSignatures does not currently support managed signatures for CefSharp, WebView2 C#, and NWBC C#.
* You cannot install an AppSignatures package with a version older than the version of the package referenced by the UIAutomation package.
