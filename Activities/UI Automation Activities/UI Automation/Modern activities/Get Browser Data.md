# Get Browser Data

UiPath.UIAutomationNext.Activities.NGetBrowserData

# 

Exports the browser session data from a specified browser instance.



The Get Browser Data activity paired with the Set Browser Data activity makes the
                use of the Picture-in-Picture (PiP) feature
                easier as it allows you to export the cookies from a specific browser profile and
                import them into the one where the automation runs.

This activity cannot be used with Chrome or Edge when the User Sync functionality is enabled.
                    This means that a user logged into a browser instance is considered logged in
                    any other instance until logged out.Currently, the Firefox browser does not support accessing browser data.After using this activity to export session
                            data, if the user logs out from an application instance, that session data does
                            not offer logged-in context, as the login token becomes invalidated upon
                            logout.

A user must log in to the web
                business application using multi-factor authentication (e.g. Salesforce). The robot
                must continue the automation execution in PiP to avoid interfering with the user’s
                work. To avoid a re-login in the PiP browser instance, the Get Browser Data
                activity is used to export the session data from the Windows main session browser
                instance, post login, while the Set Browser Data activity is further used to
                import the session data into the child PiP browser session.
