# Update UI Element (former Set Value)

UiPath.Semantic.Activities.NSetValue

# 

Uses AI to seamlessly set a value on any input field: input box, drop-down, check box, radio buttons, date picker.

It can be used only on Chrome Edge, Firefox, and Safari.

Uses the same functionality as Fill Form, but on element level.

Instead of using other activities for specific input fields (for instance, Type Into for input boxes, Check/Uncheck for check boxes, etc.), you can use a single generic Update UI Element activity. It can also deal with date pickers and groups of radio buttons.
