# UI-USG-011 - Non Allowed Attributes

Rule ID:UI-USG-011

Scope: Activity

Default action: Warning

This rule applies to activities that are part of both the Classic and the Modern UI
            Automation experiences.

# Description

Lists all selectors which contain non allowed attributes, thus offering you an easy way of keeping track of any selectors that might be faulty.

The rule ignores selectors with idx=* because this is a valid case
                used in non-greedy search.
