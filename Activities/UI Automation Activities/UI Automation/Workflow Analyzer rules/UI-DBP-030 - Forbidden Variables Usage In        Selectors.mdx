# UI-DBP-030 - Forbidden Variables Usage In
        Selectors

Rule ID:UI-DBP-030

Scope: Activity

Default action: Error

This rule applies to activities that are part of both the Classic and the Modern
                        UI Automation experiences.

# Description

Detects forbidden variables used in UI Automation selectors, both classic and modern. Ensures that no UI Automation activity in the entire project uses either variables in selectors or selectors replaced entirely by variables.

# Recommendation

In situations where you are using variables in selectors, it is recommended to refactor your code and use only string selectors.
