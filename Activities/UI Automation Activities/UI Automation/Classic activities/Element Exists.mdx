If they exist, the activity is executed.Web applications:Internet Explorer - The <webctrl> tag is used to check if the Ready state of the HTML document is set to Complete. Additionally, the Busy state has to be set to "False".Others - The <webctrl> tag is used to check if the Ready state of the HTML document is Complete.SAP applications - First the presence of the <wnd> tag verified, after which an SAP specific API is used to detect if the session is busy or not.
