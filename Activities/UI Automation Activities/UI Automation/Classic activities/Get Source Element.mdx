# Get Source Element

UiPath.Core.Activities.GetSourceElementV2

# Description

Extracts the UI element on which the action of a trigger was performed.

It supports only UiElement variables and the following activities:
                    Click Event
                    Trigger, Keypress Event Trigger, Hotkey
                    Trigger, Mouse Trigger, Click Image
                    Trigger, System Trigger.

It can be used either within a triggered workflow or within a Trigger Scope activity.

When automating using the Get
                    Source Element activity in PIP mode, if an element is no longer on the
                screen, the activity throws an error. This is because UiElement
                objects are just references of the UI element you are targeting, but do not contain
                entire object content. If the element is no longer on the screen, the method call
                fails. The Get Source Element activity and its output must be used as long
                the element is on the screen.
