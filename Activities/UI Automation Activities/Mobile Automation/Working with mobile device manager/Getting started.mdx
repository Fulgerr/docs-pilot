# Getting started

Run device automation through Mobile Device Manager without ever touching the device. To quickly understand how to automate a mobile project, set up Mobile Device Manager (MDM), and then create and run a workflow on a cloud device.

# Prerequisites for Cloud devices

* Install UiPath.MobileAutomation.Activities. For more information, see Managing Packages. Alternatively, you can use the Mobile Testing Project default template, as this will install the activity package for you.
* Create an account on a device cloud platform. For this example, create an account on Sauce Labs.

# Prerequisites for Local devices

Local devices require specific configurations in order to run mobile testing automations on them.

# Local Android device

Follow the steps described in the Prerequisites for Local Android devices topic.

# Local iOS device

Follow the steps described in the Prerequisites for Local iOS devices topic.

### Create a mobile testing project

Create a mobile testing project in Studio.

Open Studio.
Select a Mobile Testing Project from the default templates. Configure project details and then click Create.Start with the default test case created through the project.


### Configure mobile device manager

To prepare your test environment, open Studio and navigate to Mobile Automation > Mobile Device Manager to launch MDM.The Mobile Device Manager button is added to the ribbon after you install UiPath.MobileAutomation.Activities, or if you open a Mobile Testing Project template.Continue by adding a Cloud device, or a Local device and a native application, or web application
                to MDM.


### Add a cloud device

Add your first cloud device to MDM.

In the left navigation panel go to Devices.Click Add a device.Configure your device as follows:Name - Enter a name to identify your device in the Devices tab.

### Start the application

You can now start your mobile device emulator.

In the Welcome tab, click Start an application.Select a device and an application by choosing the ones you have just created.
Click Connect.It may take a while to establish a connection due to multiple connection layers and distance to your device farm.


### Record actions

Record your actions using the interaction bar, right next to your mobile device emulator. Through this, you can indicate your actions on-screen. Alternatively, you can design your workflow in Studio.

Open the Recorded Actions panel on the right side to keep track of your executed actions.On the right side of the mobile device emulator, click the Android Home, or iOS Home button.Click the Google search bar on the emulator screen and then click No Thanks to dismiss the overlay if needed.Double click on the search bar to send text and type in "UiPath Test Suite".
