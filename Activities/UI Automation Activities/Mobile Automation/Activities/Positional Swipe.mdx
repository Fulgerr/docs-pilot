# Positional Swipe

UiPath.MobileAutomation.Activities.PositionalSwipe

# Description

Swipes to a predefined location on the screen with starting and ending points.

Use this activity when the location of the object that you are looking for is not easy to find through the Swipe activity. Keep in mind that positions might be device-specific. Swiping is immediately actionable and it is not waiting for a specific target to show up. If required, add a delay before the positional swipe.Positional Swipe is not useful when you use a workflow for multiple devices because the device coordinates might change.

# Configuration

Designer panel

* Start Point Coordinates - Set the starting points for your positional swipe on the device screen.
* End Point Coordinates - Set the ending points for your positional swipe on the device screen.
* Coordinates Type - Choose how to set the target coordinates. You can select one of the following:PhysicalPixels - Use this option for workflows using a single device. Since the indication corresponds to actual pixels on the screen, it's different for each device. DeviceIndependentPixels - Use this option to run workflows on devices with similar density screens. Device-independent pixels means that you are indicating a target based on the pixel density of the selected screen area.

Common

* ContinueOnError - Specifies if the automation should continue even when the activity throws an error. This field only supports Boolean values (True, False). The default value is False. As a result, if the field is blank and an error is thrown, the execution of the project stops. If the value is set to True, the execution of the project continues regardless of any error.

* EndPointX - Set an ending point for your X axis on the device screen.
* EndPointY - Set an ending point for your Y axis on the device screen.
* StartPointX - Set a starting point for your X axis on the device screen.
* StartPointY - Set a starting point for your Y axis on the device screen.
* SwipePressTime - Set the duration of the swipe in milliseconds. Default set to: 4000.
