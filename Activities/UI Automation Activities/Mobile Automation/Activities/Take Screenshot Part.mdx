Since the indication corresponds to actual pixels on the screen, it's different for each device. DeviceIndependentPixels - Use this option to run workflows on devices with similar density screens. Device-independent pixels means that you are indicating a target based on the pixel density of the selected screen area.
* EndPointX - Set a screenshot ending point for your X axis on the device screen.
* EndPointY - Set a screenshot ending point for your Y axis on the device screen.
* StartPointX - Set a screenshot starting point for your X axis on the device screen.
