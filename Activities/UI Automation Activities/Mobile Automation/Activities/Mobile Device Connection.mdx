Common

* ContinueOnError - Specifies if the automation should continue even when the activity throws an error. This field only supports Boolean values (True, False). The default value is False. As a result, if the field is blank and an error is thrown, the execution of the project stops. If the value is set to True, the execution of the project continues regardless of any error.If this activity is included in Try Catch and the value of the ContinueOnError property is True, no error is caught when the project is executed.
* DisplayName - The display name of the activity.

Development

* Close Similar Tabs - When set as True, allows only one instance of the device type that's used in the connection, and closes any other instances.
* Wait for Page Update - When set as True, the results of the activities are displayed faster, but the overall performance is impacted negatively.
* Use Existing Connection - If set to True, Studio reuses the existing connection from Mobile Device Manager for executing the activity, only if the connection details match. Using the existing connection can reduce execution time.

Input

* Appium Url - The Appium server URL you want to use to connect to a mobile device. This field supports only strings and String variables.
* Capabilities - A collection of <String, Argument> pairs that specify the capabilities of the device you are connected to. This field supports only Collection<String, Argument> variables.
* Http Headers- A collection of <String, Argument> pairs that represent custom Http Headers that you want to add to the default Http requests. For mobile device connections opened from Mobile Device Manager (MDM), the Http headers created there display inside the collection from the inside of the activity. In contrast to the Http headers that you can add inside Mobile Device Manager, in this collection you can use variables as values for a Http header. Learn more about custom Http headers here, at the bottom of the page.
* Start Page - The start page you want to use for the mobile connection. This field supports only strings and String variables.
