# Draw Pattern

UiPath.MobileAutomation.Activities.DrawPattern

# Description

Draws a path marked by multiple points on the device screen. The points that create the path are recorded from the path of the finger on the device screen. You can add multiple finger paths to simulate screen interactions that involve multiple fingers.

# Project compatibility

# Configuration

Designer panel

* Press Type - Choose the first touch of the screen. You can select one of the following:ShortPress - short press on the mobile screen. LongPress - long press on the mobile screen. Usually used for drag and drop actions.
* CoordinatesType - Choose how to set the target coordinates. You can select one of the following:PhysicalPixels - Use this option for workflows using a single device. Since the indication corresponds to actual pixels on the screen, it's different for each device. DeviceIndependentPixels - Use this option to run workflows on devices with similar density screens. Device-independent pixels mean that you are indicating a target based on the pixel density of the selected screen area.
* Finger Path - All the points recorded from the path of the finger on the device screen, on an X-Y axis. You can move, edit, remove points, or add more points to a Finger Path. Also, you can remove the Finger Path altogether.
* Add Finger Path - Add another Finger Path. Recommended for simulating screen interactions that require multiple fingers. All Finger Paths execute simultaneously.

Common

* ContinueOnError - Specifies if the automation should continue even when the activity throws an error. This field only supports Boolean values (True, False). The default value is False. As a result, if the field is blank and an error is thrown, the execution of the project stops. If the value is set to True, the execution of the project continues regardless of any error.

If this activity is included in Try Catch and the value of the ContinueOnError property is True, no error is caught when the project is executed.

* DelayAfter - Delay (in seconds) between the time this activity is completed and the time the next activity begins any operations. The default value is 0.3 seconds. Adding a delay between activities ensures that one activity has enough time to complete before the next activity begins.
* DelayBefore - Delay (in seconds) between the time the previous activity is completed and the time this activity begins performing any operations. The default value is 0.2 seconds. Adding a delay between activities ensures that one activity has enough time to complete before the next activity begins.
* DisplayName - The display name of the activity.

Misc

* Private - If selected, the values of variables and arguments are no longer logged at Verbose level.
* WaitTime - The time (in milliseconds) that you wait for a point in the finger path to complete. This field supports Int32 values only.To work as expected, the WaitTime property should be higher than 0 for iOS devices.
