# Creating mobile automation workflows

Create workflows to automate native and mobile web applications through Studio and Mobile Device Manager.

# Prerequisites

* Studio license.
* UiPath.MobileAutomation.Activities. For more information, see Managing Packages. Alternatively, you can use the Mobile Testing Project default template, as this will install the activity package for you.
* Device farm.
* Appium server. For more information, see Prepare The Test Automation Framework.
* Configured device and applications. For more information, see Managing Devices and Managing Applications, respectively.

# Mobile Automation Conditions

* Run-time is possible without Mobile Device Manager, whereas design-time is not. This means that you can design your workflows in Studio if you open Mobile Device Manager. In contrast, you can execute your tests without having to open Mobile Device Manager.
* The settings that you configure when you set up device and applications are applied globally. For example, if you set up a device and turn off Close Similar Tabs, it is going to be reflected in Studio when you create your workflow. More precisely, if you use the Mobile Device Connection to connect to this device, the Close Similar Tab property will inherit your configuration to False.

### Create workflow using recorded actions

Create a workflow in Mobile Device Manager by indicating your actions on-screen and recording the steps. After finishing recording your actions, you can import the whole set in Studio.

Open Mobile Device Manager and start an application. For more information, see Starting an Application.Open the Recorded Actions panel on the right side to keep track of your executed actions.On the right side of the mobile device emulator, choose an individual or multiple actions from the Action Bar or interact with the device manually. For more information, see Device Interaction.Open Studio and select Do within a sequence.Navigate to Mobile Automation > Import Recorded Actions to add them to the sequence.Previously recorded actions in MDM are now part of your Studio workflow.

You can run your workflow as any other standard workflow by clicking Run File.A new connection is established to the emulated mobile device to execute your actions in real-time.


### Create workflow using Studio

To understand how to create a workflow in Studio, consider the following scenarios on how to build workflows for:

* Web
                    Automation
* Native Application
          Automation Add Mobile Automation activities to your
              Object Repository.
