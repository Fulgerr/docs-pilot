# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Insightly, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Insightly. Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.

Once established, the connection to the Insightly instance can be used in all activities of the package.
