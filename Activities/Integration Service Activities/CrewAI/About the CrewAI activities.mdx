# About the CrewAI activities

The CrewAI connector allows you to invoke agents built and deployed in CrewAI Enterprise.

This integration is only available for workflows created in UiPath MaestroTM, using the Start and
                Wait for External Agent task.

# How it works

To enable automation between UiPath and CrewAI, the activities create an
                authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for CrewAI. For details, refer
                to the CrewAI Authentication page.
