# About the Oracle NetSuite activities

NetSuite is a cloud business management suite that offers comprehensive software for an organization, with software products encompassing ERP/Financials, CRM, and e-commerce.

The Oracle NetSuite activities allow you to automate the management of your NetSuite records. Integrating with the NetSuite SOAP web services operations ("SOAP operations"), the activities enable your robots to retrieve saved searches, and insert, delete, and update your NetSuite records.



If you're using a version of the Oracle NetSuite activity package that does not support the Integration Service, you can access its documentation here.

To learn more about the NetSuite activities, see the Activities page for a complete list.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Oracle NetSuite, the activities establish an authenticated connection via the Netsuite Connector.

Before you build your first project, you must complete the steps outlined in the Authentication guide.
