# About the Freshdesk activities

Freshdesk is a customer support software that helps manage tickets, automate responses, and streamline customer interactions.



To learn more about the Freshdesk activities, see the Activities page for a complete list and descriptions.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Freshdesk, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Freshdesk. Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.

Once established, the connection to the Freshdesk instance can be used in all activities of the package.
