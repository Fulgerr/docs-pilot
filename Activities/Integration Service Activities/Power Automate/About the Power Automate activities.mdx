# About the Power Automate activities

The Microsoft Power Automate activities enable you to automate the triggering of
                    flows in Microsoft Power Automate. It connects to the service via the UiPath
                    Connector for Microsoft Power Automate. This integration is only available for workflows created in UiPath MaestroTM, using the
                        Start and Wait for External Agent task.

# How it works

To enable automation between UiPath and Microsoft Power Automate, the activities
                create an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Microsoft Power
                    Automate.
