To learn more about the TangoCard activities, see the Activities page for a complete list and descriptions.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and TangoCard, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for TangoCard. Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.

Once established, the connection to the TangoCard instance can be used in all activities of the package.
