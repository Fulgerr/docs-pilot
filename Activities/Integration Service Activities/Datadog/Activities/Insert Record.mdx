# Known limitation

Occasionally, when generating an event using Insert Record, it may take Datadog some time
        to create the record. This can lead to a "404: Not found" error, despite the activity
        returning the ID. We recommend using a Delay activity to allow enough time for the data to be transmitted
        successfully.
