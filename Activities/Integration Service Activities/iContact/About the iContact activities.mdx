# About the iContact activities

iContact is a cloud-based email marketing platform. With the UiPath for iContact integration, you can manage contact lists, and create marketing campaigns and simple automations for your customers. The activities allow your UiPath robot(s) to manage your records by executing create, retrieve, update, and delete operations on iContact objects.

To learn more about the iContact activities, see the Activities page for a complete activity list and links to the activity detail pages.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and iContact, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for iContact.

Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.
