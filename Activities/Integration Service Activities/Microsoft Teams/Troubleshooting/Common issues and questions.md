# Common issues and questions

# Are all the default scopes required for using
                the Microsoft Teams connector?

Not all the scopes configured by default when creating a connection are mandatory.
                See the Microsoft Teams authentication page to see
                which scopes are required. All other scopes are optional, and you can remove them
                from the Scope field when creating the connection.

# "Need admin approval" error message

If you receive a "Need admin approval" error message when trying to set up a connection:

Your Microsoft Entra admin must turn off or set
                        up admin consent as explained in the Configure the admin consent
                            workflow guide, or grant tenant-wide admin consent as explained
                        in the Grant tenant-wide admin consent to an
                            application guide.

If your Microsoft Entra admin cannot turn off the admin consent, they must first check and
                approve requests as explained in the Review admin consent requests guide.

# Unable to access a team or channel

Make sure you configure the connection using the necessary scopes for the respective activity. See Scopes and permissions for the scopes required by each Microsoft Teams activity.

Additionally, follow the steps described in Configure group and team owner consent to
                    applications to grant access to specific team channels and data.

# Unable to send message to a private channel

The Microsoft Graph APIs do not support sending messages to a private channel.

# What type of subscription does the Microsoft Teams connector use?

To use the Microsoft Teams connector and activities, your Microsoft plan must include access to the Teams service. For details, refer to Microsoft Teams available plans.

# How many users can I tag in a single message?

In a single message, you can mention up to 20 users and use up to 20 tags.
