# New features

We have consolidated the four Get Text Completion activities, each for a specific large language model (LLM), into one Generate Text Completion activity with a unified LLM list.

The Get Text Completion activities are no longer available in the latest version of the Amazon Bedrock activity package. They are still under support and your existing processes are not affected by this change. However, we suggest you use the newest version of the Generate Text Completion activity.

# New Features and
                Improvements

The Amazon Bedrock activities pack is no longer in preview, as this version marks the
                first official release.

This activity pack is now always displayed in the Available section of the
                Activities panel in Studio. Any activity in this package can be installed by simply
                dragging and dropping it into the canvas. Also, a cloud versioning model is used
                from now on for this package, as updates will be done automatically to the
                activities, without the neccesity of manually updating the package by using the
                    Package Manager.

Please note that from this version onwards, this activity pack is only compatible
                    with Studio v2023.10 and above.
