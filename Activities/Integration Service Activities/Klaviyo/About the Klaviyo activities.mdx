# About the Klaviyo activities

Klaviyo is a marketing automation platform that automates eCommerce SMS and email marketing to help businesses acquire, retain and grow their customers by sending marketing emails.



To learn more about the Klaviyo activities, see the Activities page for a complete list and descriptions.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Klaviyo, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Klaviyo. Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.

Once established, the connection to the Klaviyo instance can be used in all activities of the package.
