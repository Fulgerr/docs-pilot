Send Button Response must be used along with the Button Clicked event in a workflow. We recommend replacing, deleting, or replying to the button message or sending a personal message to the authenticated user by using the Response URL output from the Button Clicked event.In the Send Message to Channel, Send Message to User and Send Reply activities, Message fields are passed in key:value pairs, separated by ;. Each message field in the Button Clicked response (irrespective of key or value) will be sequentially assigned, i.e. if key1:value1; key2:value2; key3:value3 are passed in Message fields, key1 is assigned to field1, value1 is assigned to field2, key3, and so on.For a detailed user guide, see .
