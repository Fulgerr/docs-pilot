# Create Embeddings

# Description

Get a vector representation of a given input that can be easily consumed by machine
                learning models and other algorithms. This activity is intended to be used in
                conjunction with a vector database and/or the embedded model for the text and chat
                completion.

# Configuration

Model - The model to generate embeddings. Select an option from the
                        available drop-down list.Input - The text input
                        for generating embeddings. The number of input tokens varies depending on
                        what model you are using.







* API version - The API version to use for this operation. This follows the YYY-MM-DD format.
* User - A unique identifier representing your end-user. This helps Azure OpenAI monitor and detect abuse.



* Embeddings - An information dense representation of the semantic meaning of a piece of text. Each embedding is a vector of floating point numbers, such that the distance between two embeddings in the vector space is correlated with semantic similarity between two inputs in the original format. Automatically generated output variable.
* Create Embeddings - The created embeddings. Automatically generated output variable.
