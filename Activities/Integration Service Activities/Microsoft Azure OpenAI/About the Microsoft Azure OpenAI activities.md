# About the Microsoft Azure OpenAI activities

The Microsoft Azure OpenAI activity package is UiPath Integrations Service's activity package specific to Azure OpenAI. The activity package enables Integration Service customers to connect to the Azure OpenAI generative AI models and enables them to build automation workflows that use the outputs of said models.



To learn more about the Azure OpenAI activities, see the Activities page for a complete activity list and descriptions.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Azure OpenAI, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Azure OpenAI. Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.

Once established, the connection to the Azure OpenAI instance can be used in all activities of the package.
