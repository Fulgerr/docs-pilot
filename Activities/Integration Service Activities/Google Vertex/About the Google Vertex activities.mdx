# About the Google Vertex activities

Google Vertex AI is a machine learning (ML) platform that lets you train and deploy ML models and AI applications, as well as customize large language models (LLMs) for use in your AI-powered applications. Vertex AI combines data engineering, data science, and ML engineering workflows, enabling your teams to collaborate using a common toolset and scale your applications using the benefits of Google Cloud. This activity package gives you access to Google's Generative AI model, PaLM.

# Google Vertex activity package

Once established, the connection to the Google Vertex instance can be reused in all subsequent child activities.

To learn more about the Google Vertex activities, see the Activities page for a complete activity list and links to the activity details.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Google Vertex, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Google Vertex.

Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.
