# About the Microsoft Vision activities

Microsoft Vision uses advanced algorithms to process images and return information. For example, it can be used to determine if an image contains mature content or it can be used to find all the faces in an image. Other features include estimating dominant and accent colors, categorizing the content of images, and describing an image with complete English sentences. Additionally, it can intelligently generate image thumbnails for displaying large images effectively.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Microsoft Vision, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Microsoft Vision. Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.
