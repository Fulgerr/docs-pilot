* Model ID - The ID of the model to be used for text generation. Select a model from the available dropdown list.







Repetition penalty - The value which represents the penalty for penalizing tokens that have already been generated or belong to the context. This field supports Double type input.Temperature - The value used to module the next token probabilities. The range is 0.00 to 1.00. A value set to 0.00 would make it deterministic. This field supports Double type input.Max new tokens - The maximum number of new tokens to be generated. Default value is 150. This field supports Int64 type input.Min new tokens - The minimum number of new tokens to be generated. Default value is 50. This field supports Int64 type input.Stop sequences - A stop sequence is a string of one or more characters. If you specify stop sequences, the model will automatically stop generating output after one of the stop sequences that you specify appears in the generated output. This field supports String[] type input.Decoding method - The process a model uses to choose the tokens in the generated output, like sample or greedy. This field supports String type input.



* Top generated text - The generated text with the highest confidence score. Automatically generated output variable. You can use it as it is or save it with a different name.
* Generate Text Completion - Automatically generated output variable. You can use it as it is or save it with a different name.
