# About the ActiveCampaign activities

Active Campaign is a cloud-based email marketing and lead nurturing platform. It provides easy to use email marketing automated tools and fully-featured email platforms that can be used to create, send, and optimize the email marketing campaigns, by teams of all size.

To learn more about the ActiveCampaign activities, see the Activities page for a complete activity list and links to the activity details.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and ActiveCampaign, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for ActiveCampaign.

Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.
