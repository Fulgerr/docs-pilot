# About the Google Vision activities

Google Cloud Vision allows developers to easily integrate vision detection features within applications, including image labeling, face and landmark detection, optical character recognition (OCR), and tagging of explicit content.

With the UiPath for Google Cloud Vision connector, you can understand the content of an image by encapsulating powerful machine learning models in an easy to use REST API. It quickly classifies images into thousands of categories (e.g., "sailboat", "lion", "Eiffel Tower"), detects individual objects and faces within images, and finds and reads printed words contained within images.

To learn more about the Google Vision activities, see the Activities page for a complete list and descriptions.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Google Vision, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Google Vision.

Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.
