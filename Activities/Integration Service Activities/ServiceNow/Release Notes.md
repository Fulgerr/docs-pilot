### Support for long-running workflows

This connector now supports long-running workflows through the Wait for an Event and
                Resume activity. Its purpose is to suspend a job at runtime and resume the job
            whenever a certain event occurs.

Erratum – Added December 3, 2024: The HTTP Request activity was
            mistakenly announced before it was made available.

# HTTP Request activity

A new HTTP Request activity is now available, allowing you to go beyond the
                predefined activities in a given package and make requests to any endpoint of a
                vendor's API.

HTTP Request reuses the connector pre-configuration and provides transparency
                of headers, authentication, and query parameters. You can reuse any of your
                connections, and provide the endpoint and the JSON payload. Use this
                connector-specific HTTP Request activity to benefit from Integration
                Service's capabilities for connection management.

# New Features and Improvements

This activity pack is now always displayed in the Available section of the
                Activities panel in Studio. Any activity in this package can be installed by simply
                dragging and dropping it into the canvas. Also, a cloud versioning model is used
                from now on for this package, as updates will be done automatically to the
                activities, without the neccesity of manually updating the package by using the
                    Package Manager.

Please note that from this version onwards, this activity pack is only compatible
                    with Studio v2023.10 and above.

The following event trigger activities have been added to this activity pack:Record CreatedRecord UpdatedIncident Task CreatedIncident Task UpdatedIncident CreatedIncident Updated

Changes have been done to the user experience, modifying certain property names to
                make them clearer and easier to use. Also, properties are now sorted based on
                importance.

## V5.0.0

Release Date: December 20, 2022

# New Features and Improvements

Starting with version 5.0.0, Windows - Legacy projects are no longer supported. Instead, you can use the activity package for Windows or Cross-platform projects.

The minimum Studio version required for this activity pack is v2022.10.

The activity package has gone scopeless, which means you no longer have to drag and drop an activity inside the ServiceNow Scope activity to configure a connection. You can simply add your activity to the workflow and configure the connection using the ConnectionId field.

The following new activities are available in the package:

* Create New Incident
* List Incidents
* Update Incident
* When an event happensServiceNow is a Dynamic API, meaning that custom tables and fields can be added and standard tables and fields can be removed and/or renamed. Any curation done on these APIs, therefore, will only work with standard implementations of ServiceNow. If, for instance, you've changed the incident table name and altered the fields in terms of names and/or added new required fields, you'll need to use the generic activities (Get Record, List All Records, Insert Record, Update Record, Delete Record) to interact successfully with your instance of ServiceNow.Reach out to your ServiceNow administrator to determine what's necessary to interact with the resources for your use case.


## V4.0.1

Release Date: June 27, 2022

# New Features and Improvements

Both design time and run time now support the ability to select a connection to use in the Configure Connection Wizard. Before, you could only use the connection that was set as default, even when you would create multiple connections. With this new functionality, you can now select from the drop-down the connection you want to use in Studio (design time) and the connection you want to use on the robot (run time) when executing the process.

The ServiceNow activities package has been upgraded to .NET6.

Implemented telemetry changes.


## V3.0.0

Release Date: November 1, 2021

# New Features and Improvements

Versions of the ServiceNow Activities Pack that do not support the Integration Service remain available for download. You can access their documentation here.
