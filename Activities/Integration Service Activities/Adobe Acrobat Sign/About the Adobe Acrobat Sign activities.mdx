# About the Adobe Acrobat Sign activities

Adobe Acrobat Sign (formerly EchoSign, eSign, and Adobe Sign) is a cloud-based e-signature service that allows users to send, sign, track, and manage signature processes.



To learn more about the Adobe Acrobat Sign activities, see the Activities page for a complete list and descriptions.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Adobe Acrobat Sign, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Adobe Acrobat Sign. Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.

Once established, the connection to the Adobe Acrobat Sign instance can be used in all activities of the package.
