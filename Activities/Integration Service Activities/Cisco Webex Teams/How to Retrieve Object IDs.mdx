# About

This guide explains the different methods you can use to retrieve object IDs for Cisco Webex Teams activities.

# How to retrieve the Person ID

This applies to the Send direct message activity.

From design time look-up

You can directly enter the ID as a string or click the Find button to access the Get People By Display Names search bar. Type in the person's display name to find the ID.

* If you are an organization admin, the look up displays a list of persons in your organization to choose from, or you can start typing the person's name to retrieve the ID.
* If you are a non-admin user, you need to start typing the name to retrieve the person ID.

# How to retrieve the Room ID

This applies to the List all messages, Send group message, and Update message activities.

From design time look up

Click the Find button to open a drop-down list of all Group Rooms or type the room name in the search bar to filter results by name.

The search works the same for both admin and non-admin users.

Using the List all records activity

Use the List all records activity for object Room and add a condition to filter out only rooms that are of type=group.

# Adding exclusive scopes

If you are an admin user and want to create automations with exclusive scopes, make sure you add the scope when creating your connection.

For example, add the spark-admin:people_read scope when you create the connection to the Cisco Webex Teams connector in Integration Service.

![bd8eac9-cisco_scope=GUID-F0AC328B-E0A4-4691-8CE1-ACFCBECE0BF7=1=en=Default](/images/bd8eac9-cisco_scope=GUID-F0AC328B-E0A4-4691-8CE1-ACFCBECE0BF7=1=en=Default.png)

You must add the {space} and then your admin scopes in the same field.

The non-admin scopes are pre-populated. If you wish to add other scopes, see the Cisco Webex documentation.

For example, to invite new users to your organization using the Invite new user activity, you must be an administrator and use the spark-admin:people_write scope when creating your connection.
