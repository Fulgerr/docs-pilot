# About the LinkedIn activities

LinkedIn is a business and employment-oriented online service that operates via websites and mobile apps. This connector offers access to the consumer/social aspects of the application.



To learn more about the LinkedIn activities, see the Activities page for a complete list and descriptions.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and LinkedIn, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for LinkedIn. Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.
