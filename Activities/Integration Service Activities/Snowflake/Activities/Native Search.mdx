# Description

This activity posts a query to be executed on Snowflake.

The default limit for retrieved records is 1000 records.
                    You can set the LIMIT and OFFSET parameters directly in the Query
                    property (for example, SELECT * PERSONS LIMIT 2000 OFFSET 1000)
                    to paginate through all records without timing out the process.
