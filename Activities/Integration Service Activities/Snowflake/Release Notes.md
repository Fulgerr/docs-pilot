### Support for long-running workflows

This connector now supports long-running workflows through the Wait for an Event and

            whenever a certain event occurs.

Asynchronous Query Status ChangedRecord CreatedRecord Updated

# Deprecated activities

The Native Search activity has been deprecated. You can use the new query activities to achieve the same results:If you were using Native Search activity for SELECT statements, use the Execute Select Query Synchronously activity. You must provide a valid query, then select the Generate output schema button. During design time, the query builds the output properties while running and you can then use them in downstream activities as input.If you were using Native Search activity for non-SELECT statements, use Execute Any Query Asynchronously.

# Known limitation

If you generate a schema for a project and then import it to another tenant, you must remap the output fields.
