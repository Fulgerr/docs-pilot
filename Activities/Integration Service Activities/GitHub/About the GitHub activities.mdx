# About the GitHub activities

Github is a cloud-based repository hosting service used for software development and version control using Git. It offers powerful tools for collaboration, code review and code management for open source and private projects.

To learn more about the GitHub activities, see the Activities page for a complete activity list and links to the activity detail

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and GitHub, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for GitHub.

Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.
