# About the OpenAI activities

The OpenAI activity package is UiPath Integrations Service's activity pack specific to OpenAI. The activity pack enables Integration Service customers to connect to select, publicly available OpenAI APIs and enables them to build automation workflows that use popular OpenAI models such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models that power ChatGPT.

Once established, the connection to the OpenAI instance can be reused in all subsequent child activities. To learn more about the OpenAI activities, see the Activities page for a complete activity list and links to the activity details.

By using the OpenAI activities, it will be necessary to keep track of total tokens consumed by prompts submitted. Token consumption is what is used to determine monthly costs for the service and limits. For more information on usage, see the OpenAI documentation.
