# About the AWeber activities

AWeber provides simplified email marketing features and services with the ability to quickly load and manage contacts, send amazing emails, build landing pages, and analyze results.



To learn more about the AWeber activities, see the Activities page for a complete list and descriptions.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and AWeber, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for AWeber. Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.

Once established, the connection to the AWeber instance can be used in all activities of the package.
