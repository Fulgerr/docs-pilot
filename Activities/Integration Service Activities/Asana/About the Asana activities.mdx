# About the Asana activities

Asana is a work management platform to help teams organize, track, and manage their work.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Asana, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Asana. Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.

Once established, the connection to the Asana instance can be used in all activities of the package.
