# About the Calendly activities

Calendly is used for scheduling meetings professionally and efficiently, eliminating the hassle of back-and-forth emails so you can get back to work.

# Calendly activity package

Once established, the connection to the Calendly instance can be reused in all activities in the package.

To learn more about the Calendly activities, see the Activities page for a complete activity list and links to the activity details.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Calendly, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Calendly.

Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.
