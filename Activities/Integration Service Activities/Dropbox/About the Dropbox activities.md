# About the Dropbox activities

Dropbox is a popular cloud-based file hosting service that enables you to store and share your files online. This means that you can store and back up your files online for easy access from anywhere, including your home computer, your work computer, or your mobile device. Your files are stored on Dropbox’s own servers and can be synchronized on all of your devices.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Dropbox, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath connector for Dropbox. Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.
