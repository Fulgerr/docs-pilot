# About the PagerDuty activities

PagerDuty provides seamless digital experiences by quickly identifying and addressing digital operations issues. Serving as a company's digital operations hub, PagerDuty enables teams to proactively manage incidents and track platform availability, offering tools for users to act upon the issues immediately.



To learn more about the PagerDuty activities, see the Activities page for a complete list and descriptions.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and PagerDuty, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for PagerDuty. Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.

Once established, the connection to the PagerDuty instance can be used in all activities of the package.
