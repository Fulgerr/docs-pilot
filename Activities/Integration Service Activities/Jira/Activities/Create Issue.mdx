# Create Issue

# Description

Creates an issue in Jira.

# Untitled Section

text="Type the content"

# Configuration

Project - Select the project from the dropdown list or enter the project name or key. This field supports String type input.Issue type - The type of issue you wish to
                        create (task, story, bug, epic, etc.). This field supports
                            String type input.Select
                            the Project and the related Issue type to dynamically
                            retrieve additional input properties. Once the input properties are set,
                            you can use variables for the Project and Issue type
                            fields. When using variables, you can still use the same input
                            properties when creating issues in different projects, as long as the
                            properties still apply. Alternatively, create a sample Jira project with
                            an issue type that includes all possible fields across various projects
                            and issue types. This enables you to handle different fields in
                            different projects when creating the issue.







Additional fields are displayed depending on the selected Project and Issue type.



* Issue - The new issue. Automatically generated output variable.
* Issue ID - The ID of the created issue. Automatically generated output variable.
* Issue key - The key of the created issue. Automatically generated output variable.

# How it works

The authenticated Jira account must have sufficient permissions to the respective resource in each action. See Jira project permissions documentation.

The Create Issue activity creates an issue in Jira based on the specified Project
                and Issue type, and dynamic standard and custom fields are retrieved from the
                combination of both.

Once you set the Project and Issue type fields, you can replace the Project
                and Issue type dynamically, with the help of variables, so that the fields
                remain on your canvas. In this case, you can only add the issue to a project where
                all the fields (or a subset of all the dynamic fields) apply.

We recommend that you create a sample project with an Issue type that contains all
                possible issue fields across multiple projects and issue types, so that you can
                create issues across multiple projects and issue types. This is because issues can
                have different fields in different projects.

Alternatively, when dynamically creating a Jira issue, you can use the Insert Record activity with an Issues object. This scenario, however, prevents us from generating your issue input fields during design time and you must work with standard fields like Summary, Description, Assignee, etc.
