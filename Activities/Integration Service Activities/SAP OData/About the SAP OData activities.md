# About the SAP OData activities

The SAP OData Connector enables a seamless integration between SAP S/4HANA, SAP C4C and other products of SAP using the OData API’s and external systems. The connector helps automate end-to-end processes like procure-to-pay (P2P) and order-to-cash (O2C), enhancing operational efficiency and data synchronization for streamlined business operations.



# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and SAP OData, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for SAP OData.

Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.
