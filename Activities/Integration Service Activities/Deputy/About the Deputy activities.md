# About the Deputy activities

Deputy is a workforce management app for scheduling, time tracking, and communication with employees.



To learn more about the Deputy activities, see the Activities page for a complete list and descriptions.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Deputy, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Deputy. Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.

Once established, the connection to the Deputy instance can be used in all activities of the package.
