# About the Freshservice activities

Freshservice is a cloud-based IT help desk and service management software. After connecting, you can manage incidents, assets, tickets and more.

To learn more about the Freshservice activities, see the Activities page for a complete list and descriptions.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Freshservice, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Freshservice. Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.
