# Search Tickets with custom fields returned
    as part of the response

First, it is important to understand how the Freshservice API handles queries.

Freshservice permits the following enums for Status and Priority. You must use these specific
      values accordingly in the query.

For example, if you want to retrieve tickets with an unassigned agent, Open Status, and
      Urgent Priority, construct the query as follows: status:3 AND agent_id:null AND
        priority:4.

In this example, we are using a Write Line activity to annotate the count of
          tickets returned, but you can use any other attribute to be returned.

If you check directly in Freshservice, the filter returns the same value:Additionally, to retrieve custom fields for returned tickets, you can use a Get
            Ticket activity.To learn more about searching tickets, see the Freshservice API
            documentation.
