# About the Customer.io activities

Customer.io is a customer engagement platform designed for creating data-driven campaigns to reach people across all messaging channels and to send relevant messages based on behavioral data across web and mobile products.



To learn more about the Customer.io activities, see the Activities page for a complete list and descriptions.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Customer.io, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Customer.io. Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.

Once established, the connection to the Customer.io instance can be used in all activities of the package.
