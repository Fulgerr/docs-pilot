## Nested queries

In previous releases, the Coupa List All Records activity had inherent limitations when it came to utilizing a Where clause. It was restricted to querying specific fields only.

Let us consider the Invoice object that had the ability to accommodate only a limited number of Where clauses, such as created-at, updated-at and id.

An improvement has been made to enhance the support for querying properties that are nested within deeper levels. This enhancement allows for a broader range of properties to be queried.

To provide an example, you can now construct a Where clause for fields like invoice-id, status, delivery-number, and canceled. For instance, you can use "invoice-id='1234'" to query a specific invoice ID, "status='pending_receipt'" to retrieve invoices with a pending receipt status, or "canceled='true'" to find invoices that have been canceled.

Now, with the enhanced functionality, you can effortlessly query nested properties as well. For instance, you can use the following query: "supplier.name='CDW (USA)'" to retrieve invoice records based on the supplier's name.

Remember to use the Expression editor to construct Where clause and not the Filter Builder that is shown by default.

Run the activity to validate your desired filtered output.

In this case we can see that we are able to search for invoices where the supplier name is CDW (USA)

In addition, you now have the option to combine multiple filters using the Where clause by using the and operator. This allows you to further refine your query by adding additional conditions to the filter which was previously not possible.
