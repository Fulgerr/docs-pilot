# Bug fixes

* In the List All Positions activity, the date time and boolean type filters were not working as expected in the Where clause and the Filter Builder.
* When using the Where clause for filtering records, the "Exclude non recruitable positions" query parameter was not sent correctly to the vendor. This caused issues with correctly retrieving records.
