# Deprecated models

Starting May 24, 2025, Google has deprecating the Gemini 1.5 Pro 001 and Gemini 1.5 Flash 001
                models. For more information, refer to the Google deprecation announcement.

In response to this update, we are implementing the following changes to the GenAI Activities that currently use the deprecated models:

* Gemini 1.5 Pro 001 will be replaced with Gemini 2.0 Flash 001
* Gemini 1.5 Flash 001 will be replaced with Gemini 2.0 Flash 001

Note that the Gemini 2.0 Flash model is exclusively available in the Europe and United States
                regions. For details, refer to .

# New activities

We have expanded the capabilities of the UiPath GenAI Activities package with:

The  trigger, which allows you to initiate a process automatically when an index finishes synchronizing. Use the trigger in conjunction with the Update Context Grounding Index activity to ensure that any newly added documents to an index are fully synchronized before executing LLM calls.

The Wait for an Event on UiPath GenAI Activities and Resume activity, which supports long-running workflows. This activity provides the capability to pause execution at a specific point, wait for a designated event to occur within the GenAI activities, and then resume the workflow. For details, refer to .

We've refined the functionality of the Web Search activity. Before, the activity
            retrieved contextual information using Perplexity.ai and summarized top results from the
            web. The activity now performs an actual web search using the Google search engine.

A new Web Summary activity inherits the previous usage of Web Search. This
            activity is based on Perplexity.ai and uses near-real-time data to search and summarize
            results from the web.

# New activities for retrieving
                context from the web

The UiPath GenAI Activities now offer capabilities for extensive web searches with:
                    Web Reader, powered by Jina.ai, and Web Search, powered by
                Perplexity.ai. We are evaluating other search and read engines to accommodate user
                choice in the future.

Use the Web Reader activity to extract real-time text from a provided URL,
                which allows you to then use the output as context for other completion calls (for
                example, using Content Generation). Web Search uses near-real-time data to
                search and summarize top results from the web.

# Improvements

In the Content Generation, Context Grounding Search, and Update
                    Context Grounding Index activities, you can now directly input an index name
                as a string or use a variable, as an alternative to selecting an option from the
                lookup list.

### Context Grounding is now GA

Context Grounding is now generally available. Since the preview
            release in August, we have added numerous capabilities for enhanced GenAI experiences.
            Read all about it in the Automation Cloud Release Notes guide.

In the UiPath GenAI Activities, the Context Grounding GA release brings the following updates:

The Update Context Grounding Index activity replaces the Index and Ingest activity. Use the new activity to perform data sync operations with the index and the data source. We've removed the capability to create and delete indexes, which you can now do from the AI Trust Layer panel in Automation Cloud. Existing workflows using Index and Ingest will continue to work momentarily. However, we strongly recommend you start using the new UI experience in the AI Trust Layer.The Delete Index activity, previously available in Public Preview, has been removed from the UiPath GenAI Activities package. To delete indexes, use the AI Trust Layer panel.


### New activities

This release includes three new activities: , , and .

The Content Generation and Image Analysis activities now support the following models: Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o-2024-08-06. To use the Claude 3.5 Sonnet model, you must enable Anthropic from your Automation Ops AI Trust Layer policy. For more information, see Settings for AI Trust Layer policies.

We've also made minor changes in the following activities: Generate Email, Rewrite, Summarize, Detect Language, and Translate. Changes may include descriptions and default values of some fields, and the addition or removal of fields.

# New activities

The GenAI Activities now include capabilities for Semantic Similarity and
                    Image Comparison.

# Improvements

We made some small improvements to existing activities, as follows:

* In Content Generation and Image Analysis, the default temperature is now set to 0.
* In the Categorize activity, we removed the Examples field.
* We also fixed minor issues in the Named Entity Recognition activity.

# New GenAI capabilities

This release brings two new dedicated activities for image
                    analysis and object detection.


## August 26, 2024

Two new activities are now available:  and . You can use
                Categorize to classify data into specified groups and Named Entity
                Recognition to identify and categorize named entities within a data set.

# Context grounding now in Public
                Preview

We are thrilled to announce that UiPath GenAI Activities now include Context grounding
                capabilities, allowing you to bring in your data to generate more accurate, reliable
                GenAI predictions.

Context grounding is a tenant-scoped platform service designed to support UiPath GenAI
                experiences by grounding prompts with relevant information before they are executed
                by a large language model.

You can leverage Context grounding through the enhanced  activity and
                two new activities: Index and Ingest and Delete Index. Use Index
                    and Ingest and Delete Index to upload and manage your data source for
                Context grounding, then use the Context Grounding parameter in Content
                    Generation to query over documents and consume that information to augment
                or ground prompts.
