# Web Search

# Description

Web Search executes a search of the public domain using a natural language
                search query. The search results are available in the output.

Web Search offers near-real-time search results.
                    Note that time-sensitive data, like stock prices or weather, may be retrieved
                    with a lag of up to several days. You can provide date, time and/or location as
                    arguments in the query if needed, but the engine may still return delayed
                    information.
