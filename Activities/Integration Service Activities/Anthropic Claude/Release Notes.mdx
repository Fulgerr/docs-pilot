# New Features and Improvements

The Anthropic Claude activity package is no longer in preview, as this version marks the first official release.

This activity pack is now always displayed in the Available section of the Activities panel in Studio. Any activity in this package can be installed by simply dragging and dropping it into the canvas. Also, a cloud versioning model is used from now on for this package, as updates will be done automatically to the activities, without the neccesity of manually updating the package by using the Package Manager.

Please note that from this version onwards, this activity pack is only compatible with Studio v2023.10 and above.
