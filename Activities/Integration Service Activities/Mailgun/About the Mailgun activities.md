# About the Mailgun activities

Mailgun is an email automation service built for developers that offers a complete cloud-based email service for sending, receiving, and tracking emails sent through your websites and applications.



To learn more about the Mailgun activities, see the Activities page for a complete list and descriptions.

# How it works

To enable the outbound automation between UiPath and Mailgun, the activities establish an authenticated connection using the UiPath Connector for Mailgun. Before you build your first project, complete the steps in the Authentication guide from the connector documentation.
