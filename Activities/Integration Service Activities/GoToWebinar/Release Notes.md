This activity pack is now always displayed in the Available section of the Activities panel in Studio. Any activity in this package can be installed by simply dragging and dropping it into the canvas. Also, a cloud versioning model is used from now on for this package, as updates will be done automatically to the activities, without the neccesity of manually updating the package by using the Package Manager.

Please note that from this version onwards, this activity pack is only compatible with Studio v2023.10 and above.

The activity package has gone scopeless, which means you no longer have to drag and drop an activity inside the GoToWebinar Scope activity to configure a connection. You can simply add your activity to the workflow and configure the connection using the Connection field.

                connection you want to use in Studio (design time) and the connection you want to
                use on the robot (run time) when executing the process.
