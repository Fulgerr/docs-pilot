## Updating Robot Community editions

In the attended scenario, an update prompt is displayed with the following options:

* Update Now - Stops all currently running jobs and closes all active Studio
                    and Assistantcinstances. The update then proceeds immediately.
* Later - Postpones the update. The notification is muted, and you can
                    initiate the update process at your convenience. You can launch the update
                    process by clicking Check for updates in the UiPath UI icon located in
                    your system tray.

Once you approve the prompt, the update service gets the confirmation and starts the
            update process. Without a response in 24 hours from the first notification, the update
            installs automatically.

Community Preview installations running version 2021.8 or later can automatically update
            to the latest Community Preview release.

Closing Studio during the automatic update process causes the Robot to lose the
            connection to Orchestrator. This issue does not occur with licensed installations.

Refer to the Update
                Service for more details.
