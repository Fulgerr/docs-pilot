# RobotJS

UiPath's Robot JavaScript SDK, or Robot JS, enables you to incorporate UiPath automation capabilities within your JavaScript applications. It provides a set of JavaScript libraries that act as a bridge of communication between JavaScript-based applications and UiPath Robots.

This SDK extends the ability to create, monitor, and manage processes directly from JavaScript applications.

# Prerequisites

To use RobotJS, you need to:

* install Studio and Robot installed on your machine (versions 2019.10 or greater),
* install Robot JavaScript add-on on the machine that executes the process, and
* connect the Robot to your Orchestrator instance.

# RobotJS on Windows OS

To use RobotJS add-on on Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows 8 and 8.1, you need:

* Robot JS version 1.2.5+
* Robot version 2021.4.4+

# RobotJS on macOS

To use RobotJS add-on on macOS ARMv8 and AMD64, you need:

Robot JS version 1.2.7+Robot version 2021.4.4+

It functions similarly as on Windows OS, with some exceptions:

* It does not support the Safari browser,
* it does not offer a standalone version, and
* it only executes cross-platform automations.

# Getting the Robot JavaScript SDK

Studio versions 2020.4+ provide the Robot JavaScript SDK by default. Licensed under Apache 2.0, you can download and installat it using the following sources:SourceCommandNPM: The SDK is available as an NPM package with TypeScript bindings. To include it in your project, run the following command in the root of your project directory.npm install --save @uipath/robotCDN: To include the SDK, add it before the closing of the </body> tag.<script href="https://download.uipath.com/js/1.3.2/UiPathRobot.js"/>Direct download: To get the minimized version of the Robot Javascript SDK in a .js package.https://download.uipath.com/js/1.3.2/UiPathRobot.js

# Documentation

The Developer Guide combined with the User Guide offer a complete SDK and JavaScript add-on overview for Robot, detailing usage, prerequisites, and initial robot-enabled application creation.

You can also develop the Robot JavaScript SDK functionality in .NET, by using the Robot API commands.

# Specifications

* The full documentation of SDK Specifications provides detailed information on the models and methods used by the Robot Javascript SDK.
* Sample References offer pre-built samples for boilerplate and office applications that can be easily integrated in your custom application.
