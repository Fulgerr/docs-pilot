# Local File Templates

The local templates are created in the Templates folder of the project when you extract a file as template and when you add a template to the Templates folder. Local file templates are available only inside the project where you create, or extract them.

You can create local templates of three types: execution template, workflow template, and test case template. When you
            extract a file as a template, the template type is applied automatically based on the
            type of file you extract (workflow or test case). When you manually add a template to
            the Templates folder, you select the type of template to create.
