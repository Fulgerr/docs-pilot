# Creating your first coded test case

This tutorial provides step-by-step instructions for creating a coded test case that types information into a web form and verifies it using Test Manager. To automate the web form and access it, the example uses Object Repository elements and UIAutomation. You can access the sample form here.

PrerequisitesUiAutomation.Activities 23.10Testing.Activities 23.10UiPath Chrome extension

Create a coded test case. From the File group, select New, and then Coded Test Case.The code for the test case is split into three parts (Arrange-Act-Assert), similar to the Given-When-Then template.Arrange – Setup test data.Act – Perform test case steps.Assert – Verify the test case result.Retrieve the UI elements from your testing application, so you can use them in your Coded Test Case. For this example, retrieve the UI elements from the web form. Go to the Object Repository tab and create an application named TestForm. Inside the TestForm application, create a screen named TestFormScreen, and indicate the Chrome tab where the web form is open. Inside the TestFormScreen create an element for every form field, and buttons inside the form. The UI elements are ordered alphabetically, in ascending order. Start designing your Coded Test Case, using the UIAutomation and Testing services.In the Arrange section use the
                                                  UIAutomation service along with the Open and TypeInto coded automation
                                                  APIs to open the web form and input test data. For
                                                  this example, use the following code sample:var screen = uiAutomation.Open(ObjectRepository.Descriptors.TestForm.TestFormScreen);
            screen.TypeInto(ObjectRepository.Descriptors.TestForm.TestFormScreen.Name, "John Doe");
            screen.TypeInto(ObjectRepository.Descriptors.TestForm.TestFormScreen.Email, "john.doe@uipath.com");
            screen.TypeInto(ObjectRepository.Descriptors.TestForm.TestFormScreen.Password, "1234");
            screen.TypeInto(ObjectRepository.Descriptors.TestForm.TestFormScreen.ConfirmPassword, "1234");
Use
                                                  IntelliSense inside the Studio IDE. Press
                                                  Ctrl+Space and use IntelliSense
                                                  for:Autocompleting codeReading coded automation API documentation –
                                                  reading the parameters of an API. In the Coded
                                                  automations ecosystem, API parameters are the
                                                  equivalent of activity properties.In the Act section type the action of submitting the form. For this example, use the following code sample:screen.Click("Submit");In the Assert section use the
                                                  Testing service, along with the VerifyExpression coded
                                                  automation API, to verify if the text inside
                                                  Verification is the username input from
                                                  step 6. For this example, use the following code
                                                  sample:testing.VerifyExpression(screen.GetText("Verification") == "John Doe");
