The supported versions of Team Foundation Server are:

* 2012
* 2013
* 2015
* Express 2012

# Setting up TFS in Studio

1. In the Team tab, click Open from TFS or Add to TFS. The Connect to Azure DevOps Server window is displayed.
2. Click Servers. The Add/Remove Azure DevOps Server window is displayed.
3. Click the Add button. The Add Azure DevOps Server window is displayed.If Studio crashes or fails to respond when you try to add a TFS server, remove the configuration files from C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft Visual Studio\15.0_xx\Team Explorer, restart Studio, and try again.
4. Fill in the details of your TFS repository and click OK. Your team’s collections and projects are available in the Connect to Azure DevOps Server window.The Manage TFS Online button connects you to the web management interface.

If the TFS server is online (e.g. https://<account>.visualstudio.com) UiPath Studio requests authentication with a Microsoft account.

By default, on all Windows Server machines, this window is not displayed, as it requires JavaScript to run. This can be enabled from the Internet Explorer settings (Security tab > Custom Level > Enable Scripting).

# Opening a Project from TFS

1. In the Team tab, click Open from TFS. The Connect to Azure DevOps Server window is displayed.The Connect to Azure DevOps Server window has the option to switch between users when connecting to the TFS repository.

4. Click OK to confirm the selection and close the window. The Check out from TFS project window is displayed.To change the file and open the repository browser, use the button.
5. Pick a Check out directory. The project name is added to the checkout directory by default. Click Open. The project.json, .xaml and other files stored in the repository project folder are mapped locally.
6. When you open a file from Studio, for example, Main.xaml, a Question dialog box opens with two options for pulling the file from the repository:Check out latest and edit - opens the latest version of the Main.xaml file from the repository, in edit mode. The Break Lock option indicates that the file is already checkout by another user. By using this option, the lock is removed without notifying the user. Open local as read only - opens the local version of the Main.xaml file in read-only mode. The Package Manager can be opened even if the files are in read-only mode, but in order to perform changes and install dependencies, the project.json file needs to be checked out.Selecting the checkbox for Always checkout latest and edit and don't show me this again, and then the Check out latest and edit option propagates your choice for future occurrences. Regardless of your choice, the project.json file still needs to be checked out separately for certain changes to take effect.If you check out only the <code>.xaml</code> file of a library project from the TFS repository, the <code>.screenshots</code> folder does not update. Use Get Latest Version on the folder to get the files.
