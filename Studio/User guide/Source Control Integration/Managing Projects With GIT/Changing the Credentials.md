# Changing the Credentials

To update the credentials used to connect to a remote repository:

1. From the branch menu in the status bar, select Manage Remotes .
2. In the Manage Remotes dialog, right-click a remote repository and select Change Credentials .
3. Depending on how the repository was cloned (via HTTPS or SSH), either sign in to a GitHub account (for repositories hosted on github.com only), enter the username/password or the username/token, or point to a new private key and click OK. The credentials are updated in the Windows Credential Manager.
