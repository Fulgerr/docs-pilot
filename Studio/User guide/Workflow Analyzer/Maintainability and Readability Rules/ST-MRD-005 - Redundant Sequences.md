# ST-MRD-005 - Redundant Sequences

Rule ID: ST-MRD-005

Scope: Workflow

# Description

The rule finds sequences that have very few activities and could be included in other containers.

# Recommendation

Redundant sequences should not be used since they only make the workflow cluttered. For removing redundant sequences, use the Remove Surrounding Sequence option of the Designer context menu as shown here.
