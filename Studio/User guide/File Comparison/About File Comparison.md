# About File Comparison

Comparing two files can be very useful, especially if you're working with multiple .xaml files in the same project.

Studio comes with the Compare Files feature that enables you to select two similar files in the same project and compare the differences between them. It shows the activities used in the two similar workflows, together with added variables, modified properties, and changes that might have been made to selectors.

Compare Files proves useful when wanting to see changes made in a working copy of the main workflow, and not modifying the original workflow.

Another way in which files can be compared is offered by the File Diff feature for versioned workflows. The feature reveals the changes between the local copy of a file and the one versioned under GIT, SVN or TFS.
