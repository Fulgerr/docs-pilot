# 2024.10.7

Release date: 4 December 2024

# What's new

Using consumed and unconsumed test data queue items in data-driven testing

Experience greater flexibility in data-driven testing by choosing to process test
                data queues based on their consumption status. In the test data queue Query Builder,
                you can now choose to use test data queue items based on the following statuses:
                all, consumed, or unconsumed. For more information, visit .

Workflow Analyzer rule for invalid coded parameters

We have introduced the ST-USG-017 Workflow Analyzer rule for coded automations, which
                throws an error when the Execute() entry method contains
                    out or ref parameters. For more information
                about the rule and recommendations, visit .

# Improvements

* Workflow Analyzer rules tailored for coded automations are now visible in the Workflow Analyzer panel.
* Now, if a connection to Integration Service fails in coded automations, a warning message appears in the Output panel notifying you of the issue.
* An error message is now triggered when attempting to create a new project in StudioX if the required project dependencies cannot be retrieved from the available feeds.

# Bug fixes

Importing arguments of type
                            Dictionary in an Invoke Workflow File activity did not work as
                        expected in some projects.After switching to the
                        StudioX profile, you could not create a new project from a template if the
                        user interface language was set to Korean.An argument converted from a
                        variable with no default value set in Studio appeared to have a default
                        value when configuring the process in UiPath Assistant and
                        Orchestrator.Unexpected validation errors
                        occurred in some projects when converting a DataTable
                        variable.In some projects containing
                            Else If activities, the universal
                        search returned inconsistent results depending on what project files were
                        opened. The issue was fixed in the UiPath.System.Activities package
                        v24.3.0 and newer.

# Known issues

* Naming a project containing coded automations with names used in activity packages results in a compilation failure. To avoid this, we recommend to rename the project. For more information about names that can cause this issue, and how to avoid it, visit .
* Erratum - added January 17, 2025: The code that you input in an Invoke Code activity within a VB - Windows project might trigger errors related to ReadOnlySpan(Of T) and the RefStructs compiler feature. To work around this, rewrite your code according to the C# language syntax, and change the Invoke Code compile language to C#.
