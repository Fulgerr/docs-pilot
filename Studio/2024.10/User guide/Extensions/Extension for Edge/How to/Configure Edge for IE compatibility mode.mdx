# Configure Edge for IE compatibility mode

Internet Explorer mode in Microsoft Edge provides you with a way to use the legacy
            infrastructure of IE inside the Chromium-based Microsoft Edge.

To do so, go to the Edge browser > Settings > Default browser >
                Internet Explorer compatibility > Allow sites to be reloaded in
                Internet Explorer mode (IE mode) > select Allow from the drop-down
                menu.

To ensure that the URLs or local files open in a specific compatibility mode (e.g., IE9),
            you can set the compatibility mode from the Enterprise Site List Manager settings
            at edge://compat/SiteListManager (see Enterprise Site List Manager in Microsoft
            Edge).

The IE Mode compatibility must be set to IE9 or later. The default is IE5 and the
            UiPath.UIAutomation.Activities package does not support that.
