# Installing the extension on macOS


### Installing the extension in a custom folder

There are several methods for loading the Java extension from a custom directory on macOS,
            similar to the process on a Windows environment.

While these examples are based on a Java application named
                JavaDisabledElements launched from a .jar file,
            they are applicable to other applications as well.
