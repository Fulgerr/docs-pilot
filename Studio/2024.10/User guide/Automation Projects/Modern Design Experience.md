# Modern Design Experience

Starting with Studio 2024.10, the modern design experience is the only design experience
            available for all projects. The classic design experience is no longer an option at the
            project level or as a global setting. Classic activities are still available under the
                Classic category and can be added to a project from the Activities
            panel or the Add activity search bar.
