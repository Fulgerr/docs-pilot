# ST-USG-020 - Minimum Log Messages

Rule ID: ST-USG-020

Scope: Workflow

# Description

The rule checks whether the Log Message activity is used at least once per workflow.

# Recommendation

The Log Message activity is important in understanding the flow path, which is very useful for maintenance, and in identifying the source and the cause of errors when they occur.

Use a reasonable number of Log Message activities that log helpful data. For security considerations, make sure not to log sensitive data.
