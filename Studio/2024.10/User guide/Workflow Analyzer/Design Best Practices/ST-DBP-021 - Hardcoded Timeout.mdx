# ST-DBP-021 - Hardcoded Timeout

Rule ID:ST-DBP-021

Scope: Activity

Default action: Warning

This rule applies only to activities that are part of the Classic UI Automation
            experience.

# Description

Shows a list of all activities that contain hardcoded timeout values. Hardcoding timeout values for each individual activity is a bad practice, and we recommend using either default values, dynamic project-wide values, or the Project Settings feature to set timeouts for activities.
