# ST-REL-006 - Infinite Loop

Rule ID: ST-REL-006

Scope: Activity

# Description

This rule identifies potential infinite loop sequences in a Flowchart. It checks for self
                connecting nodes or connections that point back and can create an infinite loop.
                However, the rule doesn't identify such potential loops where Invoke Workflow
                activity is used to create a loop.

An infinite loop is defined as a sequence of instructions that loops endlessly, either due to the loop having no terminating condition, having one that can never be met, or one that causes the loop to start over.



The rule only checks connections, not all the conditions in the flowchart. For
                example, having both a static value in a decision that is true and one that is false
                will trigger the rule:



The rule's Default action is set to Warning.

# Recommendation

If an infinite loop was found, make sure to add a termination condition. If the loop is intended, then document the code and let users know.
