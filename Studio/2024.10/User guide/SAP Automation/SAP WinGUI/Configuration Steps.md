# Configuration Steps


### Enabling SAP GUI Scripting

In order to enable Studio to interact with SAP WinGUI, you need to perform the following configurations steps on the server side and the client side. This enables the default and recommended element detection framework SAP for interactive selection.

In relation to any security concerns, the SAP server sees no difference between SAP WinGUI communication generated by a script and the one generated by a user. The script has the same rights to run SAP transactions and enter data, just like a user would.

# On the Server Side

1. Launch saplogon.exe, log in to your SAP server using your credentials. The SAP Easy Access window is displayed.
2. Run transaction RZ11. Specify the parameter name sapgui/user_scripting and press Enter on the keyboard or Display in the SAP interface.
3. In the Display Profile Parameter Attributes window, click the Change Value button on the toolbar and set the New value of sapgui/user_scripting to TRUE. Save the changes. In case your organisation is using more than 1 instance of an SAP system, do not forget to activate the checkbox “Switch on all servers” to ensure a proper activation of SAP scripting across all servers.Depending on the SAP server version, the following parameters may be set to TRUE by default. In this case, change their value to FALSE.sapgui/nwbc_scriptingsapgui/user_scripting_disable_recordingsapgui/user_scripting_force_notificationsapgui/user_scripting_per_usersapgui/user_scripting_set_readonlyAll changes to parameters in transaction RZ11 are applied with immediate effect and are lost when the system restarts. For changes to be permanent, please contact your SAP System Administrator and use transaction RZ10.
4. Log off and back on again for the changes to take effect.

# On the Client Side

1. Access the Options menu from the Main SAP Logon window.
2. Go to Accessibility & Scripting and click on Scripting.
3. Check the Enable scripting option.
4. Clear the checkboxes for the following options: Notify when a script attaches to SAP GUINotify when a script opens a connection
5. Save the changes by clicking OK. The SAP WinGUI scripting is now enabled.


### Enabling High Speed Connections

To ensure a smooth experience while creating your SAP automation projects, enable the High Speed Connection (LAN) option in SAP. It is usually enabled by default. You can check its status as explained below:

1. Right-click the SAP connection you log into, and select Properties from the context menu. The System Entry Properties window is displayed.
2. Switch to the Network tab.
3. Click the High Speed Connection (LAN) radio button from the Network Settings section.
4. Click OK to confirm and save the changes.


### Enabling Modal Dialog Boxes

Control (amodal) display options are not supported by SAP scripting. In this case Dialog (modal) display options need to be enabled, and this is done as follows:

2. Access the F1 Help tab and select the in Modal Dialog Box option from the Display section.
3. Access the F4 Help tab and select the Dialog (modal) option from the Display section.
4. Click the Apply button to save changes and close the Personal Settings for User window. This is a per-user setting. This configuration needs to be set for each client which creates SAP automation. The default setting to Dialog (modal) for the entire system can be configured by the system administrator.


### Authorization Rights

The authorization rights verification or settings need to be performed only if the sapgui/user_scripting_per_user parameter is set to True.

SAP GUI Scripting is only available for those users that have the authorization for the Execute(16) action of the authorization object S_SCR in class BC_A.

Please speak to your SAP System Administrator and ensure that the user has appropriate authorization rights.
