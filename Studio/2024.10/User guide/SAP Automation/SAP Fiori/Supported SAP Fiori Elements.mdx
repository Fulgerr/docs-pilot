# Supported SAP Fiori Elements

The SAP modern interfaces contain a variety of specific controls you can interact with.

You can use the entire range of activities from the UiPath.UIAutomation.Activities
            package to create your automation projects. On this page, specific instructions are
            available for certain controls.

### SAP Tree Table

The SAP Tree Table represents a list of elements organized in a tree structure.



You can use the Click or the Get Text activity to interact with a node or an item in any
            of the SAP Tree Table control types.

It is recommended to use the SimulateClick property when you interact
                with SAP Tree Tables.

# Expand Tree

If the tree contains a large number of child elements, selection is done as
                    follows:Expand the tree in SAP Fiori and select the element of interest.Use Indicate on screen to select any element from the table.

The nodes to the selected item are displayed in the activity.

If the tree is collapsed and the node or item of interest is not visible, you need to
                use the SAP Expand Tree activity, which expands
                the parent tree to an active node or an active item.


### SAP Data Table Extraction

To extract data from a SAP Fiori Table, launch the Table Extraction wizard and indicate
            any cell inside the table. The vast majority of SAP Fiori Table controls are
            supported.



# Metadata

There are three values of attributes supported for extraction, which can be found in
                column nodes:

* 'fulltext' - returns the values of 'primary' or 'secondary', separated by space. When the metadata is generated, this is the default value for each found column.
* 'primary' - the type of control that can be found in a cell.
* 'secondary' - the type of control that can be found in a cell.



In the metadata XML, a new attribute is_sap_web can be found
                    in the root node 'extract-table':

* If the attribute is set to '1', the table is treated as an SAP table at extraction.
* If the attribute is set to '0' or if it is not present, then the original (non-SAP) implementation is running.

When the metadata is generated, if the table is non-SAP or not yet supported, the
                    is_sap_web attribute is not included.

The attributes can be edited from the Extract metadata property in the
                    Extract Data activity:

"<extract-table get_columns_name='1' get_empty_columns='1' columns_name_source='Longest'
      is_sap_web='1'><column name='Description' attr='fulltext' /><column name='HierarchyLevel'
      attr='fulltext' /><column name='NodeID' attr='fulltext' /><column name='ParentNodeID'
      attr='fulltext' /></extract-table>"
