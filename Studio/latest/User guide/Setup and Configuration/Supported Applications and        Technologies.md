# Supported Applications and
        Technologies

The purpose of this page is to present a complete list of supported technologies and
            applications for automation. There are two main categories:

* Native Automation -
                Applications and technologies which can be automated with just UIAutomation
                    Activities (such as Click, Get Text, and Open
                    Application ) or Wizards. Please note that some applications might also
                require corresponding extensions .
* Automation via Activity
                        Packages - Applications and technologies which require resources from
                    the following sources: UiPath ActivitiesUiPath MarketplaceUiPath
