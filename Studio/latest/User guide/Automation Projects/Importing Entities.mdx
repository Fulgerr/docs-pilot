# Importing Entities

Entities enable you to use records from the Data Service, a centralized data modelling and storage service. Entities can be used in automation processes that collect, update, and pass data to other processes. All project types can be used for importing and working with such business objects.

A modern robot must be created in the Orchestrator instance on the tenant where the Data Service is enabled.

To import an entity:

1. Open the Data Manager, then expand the Entities node. All available entities are displayed.
2. Right-click an entity, and then select Import. If you want to import all entities, right-click the Entities node instead. The Manage Entities window opens.
3. Select the entity you want to import. To find a specific entity, use the Search Entities bar and type the entity name, display name, or description. You can hover over the entries in the Fields column to see all the defined fields of each entity, or click the number of fields or records for an entity to navigate to the corresponding page in the Data Service.
4. Enter a namespace for the imported entity. The default namespace is the same as the project name. The namespace can only be edited the first time you import an entity.
5. Click Save to import the entity in your project. If you make any changes to the entity at the level of the tenant, use the Refresh button inside the Manage Entities window before actually importing it.

Imported entities are visible in the Project panel as objects part of your project.

The imported entities can now be used locally in your project as objects. If you want to perform CRUD operations on them in the Data Service as well, you need to install the UiPath.DataService.Activities pack.

After installing the UiPath.DataService.Activities pack, drag and drop an entity on top of a plus sign in the Designer panel to use the recommended activities from the pack.

Drag and drop an entity from the Project panel into the Variables or Arguments panel to create a variable or argument with the entity type.

You can manage the imported entities from the Project panel by right-clicking the namespace or an entity, and then selecting from the context menu to manage entities, remove the namespace, or remove the entity.

# Namespaces for Entities

After you import an entity in your workflow, its namespace is imported as well. You can find it when you browse for types under Referenced assemblies.

All fields part of an imported entity are available as properties for the entity namespace. Thus, when working with entities the number of variables or arguments for managing data is reduced.

In the below example, the argument is of the type defined by the entity StockPortfolio, its properties visible in the Data Manager panel are the same as the fields defined in the entity and available as properties for the argument.

Check out the Using Entities in Projects page to see how to use them.
