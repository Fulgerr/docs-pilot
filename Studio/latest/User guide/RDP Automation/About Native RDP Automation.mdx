# About Native RDP Automation

The Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is a commonly used method of connecting to another computer over a network. With the help of native RDP automation, selectors for your projects are generated just as they would on your own computer, and can be executed on computers from a network without having to install the Robot on them. You thus benefit from the full range of UIAutomation activities with little effort.

Besides the standard Windows Remote Desktop client, the Azure Windows Virtual Desktop client is also supported to automate Azure Virtual Desktop resources.

Before you can create your first automation projects, you first need to install the UiPath Remote Runtime component on the Remote Desktop machine and the UiPath Windows Remote Desktop extension on the client machine, as explained by these Configuration Steps.

If you're having a difficult time with building a process, there is also an example to help you out.
