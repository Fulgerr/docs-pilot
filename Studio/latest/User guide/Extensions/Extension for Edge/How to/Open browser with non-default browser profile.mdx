# Open browser with non-default browser profile

Starting with UiPath Studio version 2023.10, the UiPath Extension for Edge can automate
                multiple browser instances, each with a different user profile, simultaneously.

Even when using a single profile, you can open the browser with a non-default browser
            profile by using the Use Application/Browser activity.
            To specify a profile at browser start-up, you must append an argument to the browser
            command line through the Arguments property in the Unified Application
                Target input section.

For Chrome, the required argument
            is: --profile-directory="profile_path".

The profile_path is the relative path to the User data
            folder path specified for that Use Application/Browser activity.

If the User data folder path is not specified, then the profile path is relative
                to the default user data directory %LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Edge\User
                    Data.



To find the profile path in Microsoft Edge, navigate to
                    edge://profile-internals/ and retrieve it from the Profile
                    Path entry.
