# Screen resolution settings

# Description

There are two possible causes for issues regarding selectors and resolution
                settings:

1. The remote machine has a hard coded resolution setting.
2. You are using two screens with different scaling settings. When moving from one of the screens to the other, selectors are not highlighted or recognized at the right position on the screen because the settings from the initial screen have been cached.

# Solution

For the robot used to run the
                        automation, go to Orchestrator and:Enable the Login
                                    To Console and set it to No. Update the resolution
                                settings (Resolution Width and Resolution Height) with
                                the remote machine settings, as described in the Robot settings documentation.You can use one of these
                            approaches:Set the scaling on
                                both screens to the same value (100%).Log off from the VM
                                so the cached settings are cleared and log in from the other
                                screen.Reach out to the VM
                                administrator to set an own resolution/scale setting for the
                                VM.
