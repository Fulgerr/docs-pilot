# Undoing Pending Changes

Studio comes with the option to undo changes that have been made to versioned files, before you commit and push them to the remote repository.

After making changes to a file in the local repository, click Undo in the GIT context menu to open the Undo Pending Changes window.

Select the checkbox next to the files and click Undo. The files are now reverted to the state before the changes were made.

The Undo does not cover unversioned files. If you create new files and then select Undo, the files are not removed from the project. Once added to the project tree, new files remain there unless they are manually deleted.
