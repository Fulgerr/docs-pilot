# Summary

The documentation repository uses a mono-repo model. All product source documentation resides here; application code exists in a separate repository. Localization files will reside either in a dedicated repository or alongside the English source (to be determined).

The repository employs three primary branch types: `main`, `develop`, and `feature/*`. Branch naming conventions can be adjusted as needed.

- **main** is the production source, deploying to [docs.uipath.com](https://docs.uipath.com).
- **develop** is the staging branch, used for testing and validation before release.
- **feature/*** branches are for active authoring and trigger preview deployments.

Versioning is handled by directory structure (e.g., `orchestrator/latest`, `studio/2024.10`).  
No direct commits are allowed to `main` or `develop`; all changes must go through pull requests (PRs).

Authoring must always begin in a feature branch, with PRs targeting `develop` and then being promoted to `main`.

Documentation updates must be delivery-aware: all environments (e.g., cloud, on-premises) are covered simultaneously. Variables and conditional logic are used to maximize content reuse. An automated checker validates this.

Preview environments are automatically generated for each feature branch.

Merges are moderated. Only documentation owners or moderators can approve merges. Overrides are possible via structured comments when necessary.

# Repository structure and branching model

The documentation will be managed in a mono-repo. All product source documentation lives here. Application code is maintained separately. Localization files may reside in a separate repository or with the English source (TBD).

| Branch      | Purpose                              | Deployment                        |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| `main`      | Canonical source of truth            | Production ([docs.uipath.com](https://docs.uipath.com))           |
| `develop`   | Active development, staging for main | Staging preview ([docs-staging.uipath.com](https://docs-staging.uipath.com))  |
| `feature/*` | Work-in-progress authored content    | Per-PR preview (docs-dev)         |

**Rule:** No direct pushes to `main` or `develop`. All updates are submitted via pull requests, with enforced reviewer approval through `CODEOWNERS`.

# Authoring flow

## Authoring to production

```
author ➝ feature branch (docs-dev)
          |
          ▼
   PR to develop (full review, CI checks, preview URL)
          |
     - Markdown lint/style
     - Structural validation
     - Conditional flag checks
     - Product owner approval
     - Preview deploy (e.g. Netlify)
          ▼
        develop (docs-staging)
          |
          ▼
   PR to main (high-level checks, release gating)
          |
     - Release validation
     - Optional final approval (release manager)
     - Production deployment trigger
          ▼
         main (docs-production)
```

### Step 1: Authoring

- Start in a feature branch, e.g., `feat-studio-triggers-doc`.
- The working directory for ongoing development is always `latest`.
- Edit or create files within the relevant product and version folder, e.g., `apps/latest/user-guide/introduction.md`.
- Use flags (e.g., `cloudFlavor`) to conditionally show/hide content by environment, and variables for output variations.
- Push changes to the feature branch.

### Step 2: Pull request into develop

- Open a PR targeting `develop`.
- Pre-merge requirements:
  - Lint checks
  - Markdown standards enforcement
  - Ownership review (moderator/owner required)
  - Overrides possible via comment trigger (e.g., `/override-review`)
- Automatic preview link generated (Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages Preview).
- PR previews must build all relevant variant outputs (cloud and on-premises).  
  `latest/` serves as a staging area, not a finalized environment. This ensures all writers are aware of every delivery context.

### Step 3: Merging to develop

- Once approved, the PR is merged into `develop`.
- Changes are visible at [docs-staging.uipath.com](https://docs-staging.uipath.com).

### Step 4: Promote to main

- At release intervals:
  - Open a PR from `develop` to `main`.
  - Only approved, release-ready changes are included.
  - Merged changes deploy to [docs.uipath.com](https://docs.uipath.com) according to the deployment cadence or trigger rules.
