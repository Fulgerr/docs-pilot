# Step 2: Configuring the Load Balancer

This step is mandatory for a multi-node HA-ready production deployment or a single-node evaluation deployment with a dedicated Task Mining and/or GPU node.If you are configuring a single-node evaluation deployment without a dedicated Task Mining and/or GPU node, proceed to Configuring Azure SQL.If you are using the Azure Internal Load Balancer (LB) for deployments, you can encounter issues with the calls from the backend Virtual Machine (VM) to the LB frontend IP. The issues occur due to source IP and MAC address mismatch of the network packet. This prevents the recipient from working out the correct response path, resulting in the failure of calls from the VM to the LB. For more details, see Azure Load Balancer Components limitations and Backend Traffic Troubleshooting.
