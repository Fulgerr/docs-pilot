# Description

This error could be found in the log of a failed job, with one of the following job names: services-preinstall-validations-job, kerberos-jobs-trigger, kerberos-tgt-update.

# Solution

Make sure the AD user still exists, is active, and their password was not changed and did not expire. Reset the user's password and regenerate the keytab if needed.

Also make sure to provide the default Kerberos AD user parameter <KERB_DEFAULT_USERNAME> in the following format: HTTP/<Service Fabric FQDN>.
