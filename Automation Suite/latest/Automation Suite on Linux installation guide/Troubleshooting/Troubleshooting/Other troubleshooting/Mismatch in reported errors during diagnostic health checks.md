# Mismatch in reported errors during diagnostic health checks

# Description

In certain situations, you might notice a discrepancy in the error count displayed by the diagnostic health check. This presents as two error counts shown by the health check, but only one error visible in the console logs. Additionally, status symbols denoting successful and failed checks might not render properly across different terminal interfaces.

# Solution

To avoid these issues, you must use output flags such as json or yaml to make the output locale agnostic. These flags aid in providing a clearer visualization of the health check statuses, regardless of the local settings of the terminal interface.

If the status symbols are not properly displayed on a terminal interface due to locale settings, you can switch to json or yaml outputs, by using the following commands.

./bin/uipathctl health check -o json

./bin/uipathctl health check -o yaml
