# Secret not found in UiPath namespace

# Description

If service installation fails, and checking kubectl -n uipath get pods returns failed pods, take the following steps.

# Solution

1. Check kubectl -n uipath describe pod <pod-name> and look for secret not found.
2. If the secret is not found, then look for credential manager job logs and see if it failed.
3. If the credential manager job failed and kubectl get pods -n rook-ceph|grep rook-ceph-tool returns more than one pod, do the following: delete rook-ceph-tool that is not running. go to ArgoCD UI and sync sfcore appllication. Once the job completes, check if all secrets are created in the credential-manager job logs Now sync uipath application.
