# Configuring NLog


### Adding NLog extensions

Orchestrator loads the following extensions by default, so you do not need to include them in the folder or the NLog configuration:

* NLog.Targets.ElasticSearch
* UiPath.Orchestrator.Logs.Elasticsearch
* Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.NLogTarget
* NLog.Extensions.AzureEventHub

Only Linux-compatible extensions can be used in this setup, so make sure that your chosen NLog extension abides by this rule.

To make the extension available for use, it must uploaded to the cluster storage. The uipathctl command line tool can do this via the uipathctl config orchestrator upload command:

./bin/uipathctl config orchestrator upload --nlog-extensions-directory /path/to/extensions/directory

If you use an external storage configuration at the cluster level, you must indicate this by including the --is-external-storage parameter.
