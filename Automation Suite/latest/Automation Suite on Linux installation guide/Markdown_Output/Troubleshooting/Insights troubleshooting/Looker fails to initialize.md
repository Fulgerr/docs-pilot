# Looker fails to initialize

During Looker initialization, you might encounter and error stating RuntimeError: Error starting Looker. A Looker pod failure produced this error due to a possible system failure or loss of power. The issue is persistent even if you reinitialize Looker.

To solve this issue, delete the persistent volume claim (PVC) and then restart.
