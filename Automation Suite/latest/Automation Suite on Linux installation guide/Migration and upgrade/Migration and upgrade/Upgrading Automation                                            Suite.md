# Upgrading Automation
                                            Suite

Starting with Automation Suite 2025.10, NFS
                                                  server-based backups will not be supported if you
                                                  are using an external objectstore. Your backups
                                                  will be stored directly in the external
                                                  objectstore. If you are upgrading to 2025.10, you
                                                  are encouraged to switch to the external
                                                  objectstore for backups.Learn more about Configuring the external
                                                  objectstore or reach out to support.Automation Suite 2023.4.5 and 2023.10.2
                                                  include an upgrade to Kubernetes 1.26.11. As such,
                                                  when upgrading Automation Suite, you must ensure
                                                  you do not downgrade Kubernetes. To do that, when
                                                  moving from Automation Suite 2023.4.5 or a later
                                                  minor version to the next major version, you must
                                                  upgrade to 2023.10.2 at a minimum.For the available upgrade paths, see Automation Suite upgrade paths.If you upgrade from an Automation Suite
                                                  version installed a machine with FIPS 140-2
                                                  disabled, you can enable FIPS 140-2 by following
                                                  the instructions on Security and compliance.You cannot enable or disable any product during
                                                  an Automation Suite upgrade.If you upgrade to Automation Suite 2024.10 and
                                                  want to use Document Understanding modern
                                                  projects, you must meet the additional hardware
                                                  requirements we specify in .

## Requirements

* Make sure you meet the hardware and software requirements for the new Automation Suite version. If AI Center is enabled, make sure you meet the CUDA requirements.
* Make sure you follow the Automation Suite upgrade best practices and perform the upgrade process that best suits your needs.


## Upgrade process

Automation Suite supports two upgrade processes:

* In-place upgrade
* Side-by-side upgrade


## In-place upgrade process

## Side-by-side upgrade 

The Automation Suite side-by-side upgrade leverages an enterprise upgrade experience that is usually called blue-green and is a standard process across the industry.

* The side-by-side upgrade allows you to perform an upgrade safely using a parallel environment instead of upgrading in place.
* This method allows administrators to switch traffic from the old Automation Suite cluster (i.e., the blue deployment) to the new Automation Suite cluster (i.e., the green deployment) after verifying the new deployment. If you detect a problem, you can quickly roll back to the old deployment.

1 You can upgrade from any Automation Suite version, but an intermediate
            upgrade between your initial and targeted versions might be needed. For details, see
                In-place
                upgrade paths.

2 You can upgrade from any Automation Suite version, except for 2021.10. For
            details, see Side-by-side upgrade paths.

3 For details, see Data migration and
                responsibilities.

4 Side-by-side upgrades require additional hardware. You can either bring a
            parallel environment with the same specifications as the source cluster or start with
            hardware required for a single-node cluster and scale it up.


## In-place upgrade paths

The following matrix shows the available in-place upgrade paths for Automation Suite
            versions:

* - a direct in-place upgrade path
                between major versions is available;
* - an intermediate in-place upgrade
                between your initial and targeted major versions is needed. If you need to upgrade to an intermediate version,
                        then you can use intermediate version as the base version to continue
                        upgrading along the upgrade path.

In-place upgrade paths are specific to Automation Suite on Linux. For Automation Suite on
            EKS/AKS, on the one hand, you must maintain Kubernetes compatibility. For Automation Suite
            on OpenShift, on the other hand, you must maintain OpenShift compatibility.

We strongly advise upgrading to the
                most recent minor version of Automation Suite. This allows you to take advantage of
                the latest enhancements and guarantees the seamless operation of all internal
                components.

In some cases, upgrading
                        Automation Suite requires transitioning through an intermediate version or
                        skiping some versions entirely to maintain the smooth functioning of the
                        internal components. Not following the upgrade guidelines in the previous
                        table may lead to an internal component downgrade or an unsuccessful
                        internal component upgrade, thereby causing the Automation Suite upgrade to
                        fail.Only upgrades to Automation
                        Suite 2023.10 and later leverage the simplified upgrade process.


## Side-by-side upgrade paths

The following matrix shows the available side-by-side upgrade paths for Automation Suite
            versions:

* - a direct side-by-side upgrade path
                between versions is available;
* - a side-by-side upgrade between
                your initial and targeted versions is not possible.

We strongly advise upgrading to the
                most recent minor version of Automation Suite. This allows you to take advantage of
                the latest enhancements and guarantees the seamless operation of all internal
                components.

## Upgrade best practices

If you can bring an additional environment to perform the upgrade, we
            recommend choosing the side-by-side upgrade path as it provides a safer upgrade approach
            and instant rollback.

If you cannot bring an additional environment to perform the upgrade, you can opt for the in-place upgrade. Make sure to follow the upgrade validation best practices.


## Upgrade validation best practices

# Environments

We recommend preparing two similar Automation Suite environments, regardless of whether you want to use the in-place or side-by-side upgrade:

* Automation Suite multi-node cluster for dev or QAThe dev/QA environment does not need to be online all the time if not used for anything else than upgrade validation.
* Automation Suite multi-node cluster for production

# Backup

It is strongly recommended to create a backup of the cluster and the SQL database before upgrading Automation Suite. This is to ensure you can restore the cluster if something goes wrong during the upgrade operation.

Cluster data is backed up on the NFS server. Make sure you have configured the NFS server before proceeding.

# Authentication

Make sure to copy the value of global.userInputs.identity.krb5KeytabSecret to global.kerberosAuthConfig.userKeytab if you simultaneously meet the following requirements:

* You configured the Active Directory integration using username and password;
* You have Windows authentication enabled;
* You do not use SQL integrated authentication.


## Automation validation best practices

To validate the automations that you built, create separate organizations or tenants directly in your Automation Suite production environment, as it is the most cost-effective solution. For more best practices, see Orchestrator - Automation Best Practices.


## Version validation

To validate your automations in different environments and versions, leverage your second Automation Suite cluster after installing the new Automation Suite cluster but before switching the traffic to the new cluster in production.


## Licensing

Upgrading to a new Automation Suite version does not require an additional license, regardless of which upgrade path you choose. However, if you follow our best practices, and use two Automation Suite clusters (one for QA/dev, and another for production), you need a license per cluster.
