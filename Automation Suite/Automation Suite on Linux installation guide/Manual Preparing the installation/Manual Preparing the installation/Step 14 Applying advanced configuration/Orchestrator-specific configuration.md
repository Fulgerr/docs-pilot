# Orchestrator-specific configuration

If you upgrade from Automation Suite 2022.10 to Automation Suite 2023.4 or later, and Orchestrator is enabled on both the old and new versions, you must set the orchestrator.block_classic_executions flag to true in the cluster_config.json file. Using the flag shows that you agree with blocking classic folders executions. Not using the flag causes the upgrade operation to fail. This parameter is not required in new installations.

# Storage

By default, Orchestrator uses the cluster storage, where data for all services and all tenants is stored in a single bucket. However, Orchestrator storage options can be customized separately from the cluster storage. This explicit configuration allows you to modify the settings in such a way that they emulate a previous Orchestrator version, where data for each tenant was stored in a separate bucket. You can configure this functionality in the orchestrator.legacy_object_storage section. For more information about configuring the Orchestrator object storage, see .

# Robot logs

Orchestrator can save robot logs to an Elasticsearch server. You can configure this functionality in the orchestrator.orchestrator_robot_logs_elastic section. If not provided, robot logs are saved to Orchestrator's database. For more information, see .

# Encryption key per tenant

Encryption key per tenant is configured in two steps:

1. Add the basic configuration to the configuration file. To do that, edit the file's orchestrator.encryption_key_per_tenant section.
2. Enable the encryption key per tenant in the Orchestrator specific configuration (post installation).
