# Migration compatibility matrix

When migrating from a standalone product to Automation Suite, you must make sure the
            versions of the standalone product, UiPath.OrganizationMigrationApp, Automation Suite,
            and the Identity and Orchestrator migrators are compatible.

The following table describes the version compatibility required to perform a migration
            to Automation Suite:


| Source                             standalone product version | UiPath.OrganizationMigrationAppversion | Target                             Automation Suite version | Identity migrator | Orchestrator migrator |

How to read the tableAs an example, to migrate
                standalone Orchestrator 2024.10.0, you must use
                UiPath.OrganizationMigrationApp 2024.10.0 and make sure that you installed
                Automation Suite 2024.10.0.For information on updates to
                the UiPath.OrganizationMigrationApp and the migration workflows, see the
                release notes for your targeted Automation Suite version. The links to the
                release notes are available in the Automation Suite version
                column.If there is no entry dedicated to the
                    UiPath.OrganizationMigrationApp in the release notes, this means that we
                    made only minor improvements to the tool.
