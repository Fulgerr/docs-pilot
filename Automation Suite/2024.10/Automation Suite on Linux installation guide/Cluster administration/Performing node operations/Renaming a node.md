# Renaming a node

You can rename nodes during the Automation Suite installation. Make sure to give each node a distinct, non-default name. Avoid using common default names, such as localhost.localdomain, as this may potentially cause network conflicts or confusion due to transient hostnames assigned by DHCP.

Renaming a node post-installation is not supported. Attempting this operation could lead to a cluster failure.
