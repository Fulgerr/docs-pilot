# Scaling a single-node (evaluation) deployment
        to a multi-node (HA) deployment

You can convert a single-node (evaluation) deployment to HA setups by bringing the
            additional hardware needed for multi-node deployments. You must meet the hardware and software
                requirements needed for multi-node production deployments.

We have known
                issues in scaling the cluster in offline environments with in-cluster registry in
                Automation Suite versions 2024.10.0 and 2024.10.1.

To convert your single-node (evaluation) deployment to a multi-node (HA) deployment,
            follow these steps:

1. Add additional server and agent nodes by referring to the page.
2. Set or edit the following fields in the cluster_config.json
                    file: {
....
"profile": "ha",
"fault_tolerance": 1,
...
}
3. Run the infra installation on the first node again by referring to Installing the
                    infrastructure on the first server machine step.
4. Complete the installation by referring to the Completing the
                    installation step.
