# Glossary


## Node

Any bare-metal or virtual machine on which you can install Automation Suite.


## Kubernetes Cluster

A set of nodes that host containerized applications.


## Provider

A service or API required by an application to function. It is a generalization of the ArgoCD application, as it may not necessarily result in an actual deployment, but only in a configuration to an external system. For example: an object store can be an internal Ceph application, or an external S3 bucket provided by MinIO.


## Dependency

A relationship between two ArgoCD applications, where one requires the other in order to function.


## Resource Utilization

The resource consumption of a product during its usage.


## Resource Request

The machine resources (CPU, memory) a product needs for an optimal installation and behavior. The associated resources are blocked for the entire product lifetime.


## Offline Environment

A setup where the machines do not have access to the internet.


## Agent Node

A machine hosting the worker pods (the functional services). You can design a machine to be used as both a server and agent. Having separate server and agent nodes in a deployment is a topology design decision.


## Server Node

A bare-metal or virtual machine hosting the cluster management server.


## Application

Sometimes referred to as an ArgoCD-managed application, an application is an ArgoCD object that wraps around a Helm chart. It normally denotes a Helm chart deployment. ArgoCD manages the applications delivered in Automation Suite. Example: ceph, orchestrator, platform.


## Shared Components

These components are shared by UiPath® products and services, and include Redis cache, monitoring and logging components, as well as backup related components.


## Services Stage

A step in the installation process where service applications are installed.


## ArgoCD

A declarative GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. It is designed as a Kubernetes controller that continuously monitors UiPath® running applications and checks the current state against the target state as specified in the docker registry.


## UiPath® Product

Sometimes referred to as a product, a UiPath® product is a collection of one or more applications that, together, provide a user-accessible service, for example, Orchestrator, Document Understanding, and others.


## Services

A collection of applications installed during the execution of the installer for the services stage. Examples: platform, orchestrator, sfcore, uipath, webhook.
