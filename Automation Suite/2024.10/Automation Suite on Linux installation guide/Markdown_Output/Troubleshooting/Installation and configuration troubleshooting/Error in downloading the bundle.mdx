# Error in downloading the bundle

# Description

The documentation lists wget as an option for downloading the bundles. Because of the large sizes, the connection may be interrupted and not recover.

# Solution

One way to mitigate this could be to switch to a different download tool, such as azcopy (more information here). Run these commands, while updating the bundle URL to match the desired version/bundle combination.

wget https://aka.ms/downloadazcopy-v10-linux -O azcopy.tar.gz
tar -xvf ./azcopy.tar.gz
azcopy_linux_amd64_10.18.0/azcopy copy https://download.uipath.com/automation-suite/2023.4.0/as-2023.4.0.tar.gz /var/tmp/as.tar.gz --from-to BlobLocal
