# Evaluating your storage needs

The information on this page only applies if you use in-cluster storage. If you use an Azure storage account, AWS S3, or other S3 compatible storage, you do not need this.

An Automation Suite cluster uses the objectstore disks attached to its server nodes as storage resources available to all the products enabled on your cluster. Each product uses these resources differently.

To understand your storage needs and plan for them accordingly, refer to the following terminology and guidelines.

### Terminology

* Server node disk size – The size of all individual disks attached to each server node. Disks on each server may have different sizes as long as the sum of all the disk sizes is identical on all servers.
* Total cluster disk size – Server node disk size multiplied by the number of server nodes.
* Application available storage – The amount of storage available for applications to consume. Application available storage is lower than the total storage attached. This is to ensure we have a higher resiliency to fault tolerance and high availability.

The following table describes the multi-node HA-ready hardware requirements for the Complete product selection in the context of the previously introduced terms.


| Number of server nodes | Server node disk size | Total cluster disk size | Application available storage |
| --- --- --- ---| 3 | 512 GB | 1.5 TB | 512 GB |


### Estimating the storage used by your applications

As you enable and use products on the cluster, they consume some storage from the application available storage. Products usually have a small enablement footprint as well as some usage-dependent footprint that varies depending on the use case, scale of use, and project. The storage consumption is evenly distributed across all the storage resources (data disks), and you can monitor the levels of storage utilization using the Automation Suite monitoring stack.
