# About uipathctl

uipathctl is a UiPath® command-line tool that allows you to perform various operations in Automation Suite on EKS/AKS, Automation Suite on OpenShift, and Automation Suite on Linux.

You can use uipathctl to check prerequisites in your environment, install Automation Suite, as well as configure and manage it from a single unified CLI.

Note, however, that not all commands referenced in this guide are suitable for all Automation Suite flavors. If certain commands are exclusive to one Automation Suite flavor, they should be marked accordingly.

It is important to be aware of the specific naming conventions we employ for the Automation Suite configuration file. The input.json name is used for Automation Suite on EKS/AKS and Automation Suite on OpenShift, whereas cluster_config.json is specific to Automation Suite on Linux only.

For more information, including a complete list of uipathctl operations, see the uipathctl reference documentation.

You can install uipathctl on the Linux, macOS, and Windows platforms.
